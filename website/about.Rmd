## Capstone Project

As the final requirement from the Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) 
program through UC Berkeley, the [Capstone course](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/curriculum/synthetic-capstone-course) 
puts teams of 3-4 people together on a single, semester long, full data science 
life cycle project. The project allows us to put to use all of the skills 
accumulated throughout the program, as well as create a quality piece for our data 
science portfolio.
