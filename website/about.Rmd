## Capstone Project

As the final requirement from the Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program through UC Berkeley, the [Capstone course](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/curriculum/synthetic-capstone-course) puts teams of 3-4 people together on a single, semester long, full data science life cycle project. The project allows us to put to use all of the skills accumulated throughout the program, as well as create a quality piece for our data science portfolio.

## How It's Made

### Tech Stack

[SoftLayer](http://www.softlayer.com/) was used for the virtual servers hosting the website and database. Postgresql is the database we store data collected from the various data sources mentioned. The data collection came mostly from scripts written in R or Python. The content and styling for the website was generated using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html). The visualizations were made using the [fantastic libraries available in R](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/). The interactive prediction apps run on [Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/). To quickly develop code in R using the same development environment, we use [RStudio Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). To collaborate and share code, we use [Github](https://github.com/raybuhr/w210_beer_demand). For domain registration service we used [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration.aspx).

### Predictions

The beer rating prediction used the Random Forest algorithm? Now it is a linear model?
