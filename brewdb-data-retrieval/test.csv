It is a mildly hoppy pale ale using a 2 row, vienna, and munich malts for body,color, and head retention. It is hopped with American west coast hops later in the boil giving it a nice citrus hop flavor and very mild aroma. Slight addition of a roasted caramel malt gives ""633"" it's signature 'sunset over the harbor glow'.",1.008,,,,,25,42,30,ZsQEJt,"""633"" American Pale Ale",1.044,False,,beer,,,American Pale,,14,6,verified,North American Origin Ales,2015-04-20 21:43:59,
7,7.5,BU4IJP,2012-09-09 13:35:27,"Milwaukee Brewing Co’s take on a classic European style. Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The “Admiral” Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.

We first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as “Shake Down Nut Brown”. You can guess what went wrong from there… But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.

We use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.",1.016,,5.0,Pint,5.0,23,40,35,tmEthz,"""Admiral"" Stache",1.072,False,1.071,beer,,,Baltic Porter,37.0,40,40,verified,Other Lager,2015-12-16 18:47:43,2012.0
