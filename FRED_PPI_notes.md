# FRED data on Producer Price Index 

## Context and background notes for Price Index data:

### What is a Producer Price Index?
*From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index*

> A Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average changes in prices received by 
> domestic producers for their output. It is one of several price indices.

*From http://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htmhttp://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htm*

> The Producer Price Index (PPI) program measures the average change over time in 
> the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices 
> included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products 
> and some services.

*From http://www.bls.gov/ppi/ppifaq.htm#13*
> There are three main PPI classification structures which draw from the same pool 
> of price information provided to the BLS by cooperating company survey respondents:

> - Industry classification. 
> A Producer Price Index for an industry is a measure of changes in prices 
> received for the industry's output sold outside the industry 
> (that is, its net output). The PPI publishes approximately 535 industry price 
> indexes in combination with over 4,000 specific product line and product category 
> sub-indexes, as well as, roughly 500 indexes for groupings of industries. North 
> American Industry Classification System (NAICS) index codes provide comparability 
> with a wide assortment of industry-based data for other economic programs, 
> including productivity, production, employment, wages, and earnings.

> - Commodity classification. 
> The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products and 
> services by similarity or material composition, regardless of the industry 
> classification of the producing establishment. This system is unique to the 
> PPI and does not match any other standard coding structure. In all, 
> PPI publishes more than 3,700 commodity price indexes for goods and about 800 for 
> services (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), organized by product, 
> service, and end use.

> Commodity-based Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) System. 
> Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup commodity indexes for goods, 
> services, and construction at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, 
> according to the type of buyer and the amount of physical processing or 
> assembling the products have undergone.
