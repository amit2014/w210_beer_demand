<h1>FRED</h1>
<p><strong>From the <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/fred.html">Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FRED® stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data. FRED® contains frequently updated US macro and regional economic time series at annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily frequencies. FRED® aggregates economic data from a variety of sources- most of which are US government agencies. The economic time series in FRED® contain observation or measurement periods associated with data values. For instance, the US unemployment rate for the month of January, 1990 was 5.4 percent and for the month of January, 2000 was 4.0 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the FRED API to extract data on the supply and sales of beer over a 20 year period, as well as price indices for breweries.</p>

<h3>What is a Price Index?</h3>
<p><strong>From the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htmhttp://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htm">Bureau Of Labor Statistics</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Producer Price Index (PPI) program measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products and some services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data on price indices shows PPI for several different goods produced by breweries. A PPI always has an initial date at which the index began. This index date is usually when the agency recording began collecting data and is set to 100 for each of the categories below. The index date for each category below is June 1, 1982.</p>
