"We are a three-barrel brew house born from the shadows of long tenured Portland restaurant, Philadelphia’s Steaks & Hoagies. The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon’s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.

We reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.

Although most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60′ TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events. Go Blazers!

"History books tell us that local Vermonter and beer enthusiast Ethan Allen was a leader inthe effort to make Vermont the fourteenth star on the U.S. flag in 1791. And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.

Today, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.

14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.

Nanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.

What makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it’s about the only brewery in Vermont that’s located above Burlington. Period.

But that’s not it. Not entirely.

You see – this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that’s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.
On our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July. (Check out our Pint of Progress on our home page.)

Being born and raised in White Sulphur Springs, owner Barry Hedrich had a great appreciation for the hardworking, rural lifestyle known to many in the area. With its high elevation and cool evening temperatures,the area is known for its high quality wheat and malting barley. After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby – brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.

"All families have their stories: tales of grandparents and great-grandparents and the incredible things they accomplished, or lived through, or overcame. My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.

Back in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.

I grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife’s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.

This is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.

"The 350 Brewing Company has spawned from the ashes of our failed Collegiate careers at Northern Illinois University. Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to ""550 degrees""? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That’s what craft beer is…a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well…..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.

Once NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik’s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! 

From that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park’s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.

"Rumour has it that you can’t keep an old monk down on the monastery once his yeast has gone viral.

Say what? Are you asking yourself, “What the hell are they talking about?”

processIt goes like this. British monks loved to put their bald heads together, eat gruel and make killer good beer. Let’s face it. This was the Middle Ages, the insulation in those drafty monasteries sucked, so beer making kept them busy, and after a few pints, who gave a damn about the cold.

But these dudes were on to something. Using only barley, wheat, hops and pure water and being tight-assed about things like purity (they were monks after-all), they developed a system for making beer that has stood the test of time. And you thought ancient purity laws has something to do with chastity.

That same British monk-inspired beer yeast begat yeast off-spring. It is from this very same yeast that we make our beers. How’s that for a DNA profile?

But we’ve taken things a step further. We use the Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System. For you non-beer geeks Peter Austin was The Granddaddy High Brew Master of Microbrewing. This was the man who started it all.

The Peter Austin system is a direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator, and you cannot buy it at Costco when you get a Vitamix. The Austin system is a rugged, reliable and easy to operate, clean and maintain.

There are more than 100 Peter Austin Brewing Systems installed worldwide, but Four Mile Brewery is the only brewery in Western North America using his system.

Although Peter Austin has left this mortal coil for a beer garden in the sky, his gifted protégé carries on his vision.

Alan Pugsley is our Brew Master at Four Mile. Pugsley is not just our brew master. He travels around waving his frothy magic wand amongst all his other projects around the world. What is distinctive to Alan’s process is his know-how when developing beer recipes. His recipes honour true British beer making while masterfully tweaking things to incorporate regional ingredients while developing taste profiles that appeal to local palates.

As Peter Austin taught Alan Pugsley, so too did Pugsley teach our own resident brewer, Doug White. White is part of the family clan at Four Mile. In 1985 he headed off on a beer quest walk-about.

And, these places happen to be connected by a common thread. Unseen to the naked eye, yet felt in its magnetic persuasion. It is the 42nd Parallel. Crossing Russia, Italy, France, and Spain. And Great American cities like Boston, Detroit, and Buffalo. It’s the border of California and Oregon, New York and Pennsylvania, and, in many instances, countries including the United States and Canada.

And when it comes to beer, the 42nd parallel is unparalleled as well. Some of the world’s best hops grow along it, and in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, it’s where New York State hops grew bountiful and full-bodied.

Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality.

With this approach you get ‘scientific’ beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That’s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.

"Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.

In 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.

Marcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. ""Why not start a brewery?"" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.

Maybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.

While researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.

In December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",1986,VPHkaP,Alaskan Brewing Co.,False,brewery,http://www.alaskanbeer.com

For the purpose of storing the beer, winter ice from canals was kept in special double-walled cellars. Originally, the beer was mostly drank in Amsterdam.

"Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com",1992,xMLyOI,Andrew's Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://mainebrewersguild.org/brewers/andrews-brewing-company/

"Angel City Brewery is excited to be part of the brewing renaissance of Downtown LA by bringing old-world, small-batch, craft brewing to the new world of the expanding Arts District. We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.

Angel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA’s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.

On January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.

Since January 2012, we’ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.

In February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we’re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

Moving our family to Oregon was a natural choice.  We found the most beautiful apple orchard in the Applegate and absolutely fell in love with it.  Knowing nothing about orcharding we had our work cut out for us.  We had to learn quickly and made plenty of mistakes along the way.

"Back Forty is a micro brewery based out of Gadsden, Alabama. With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.

The name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the ""Back 40"" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.

The craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. 

The company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. 

We've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, ""Naked Pig Pale Ale"". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.

The only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.",2009,KkUzjZ,Back Forty Beer Company,False,brewery,http://www.backfortybeer.com/

"Backroom Brewery is a boutique farm brewery nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah River Valley.  We began as a herb farm, growing culinary and medicinal herbs for the garden center trade. 
 
Our herb farm, Sunflower Cottage, grows 120,000 potted herb plants each spring from seeds and cuttings to sell to other garden centers and to our own customers. 
 
In the fall of 2012, we built our hops field.  After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.
 
In 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.
 
Our first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. 
 
Life is good and we are living the dream. 
 
We now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. 
 
Our tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.
 
In the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.

The premium beers that we brew have grown from roots grounded deeply in tradition. Our dedicated Brewmaster uses time-tested recipes and brewing methods in our traditional, English-style brewery. Our hops and malts are sourced from around the world as to provide true styles with the unique twist of glacial water. This combination yields beers that are absolutely the best that they can be.

"Over the course of five years of entering and judging beer competitions, we noticed a simple, but largely unrecognized insight: the best, most innovative beers in America are being brewed by homebrewers. In almost every competition we judged, the award-winning homebrewed beers were more inventive and daring than the majority of commercially available beers on the market. That insight, along with an enduring passion for the craft of beer making, led us to create the Barebottle, a San Francisco crowd-inspired craft brewery.

Our philosophy and process is pretty simple:
1) Use the things that inspire us every day from the SF/Bay Area as the foundation for each new beer we make.

2) Inspire our merry band of super-talented homebrewing experts (which includes our head brewer, the founders, and some of the bay area’s best homebrewers) to create new beers.

3) Just like in regular competitions, we pilot-brew a select group of the best finalist beers and ask visitors to the brewery to cast their vote for their favorite beer. May the best beer always win.

We believe that this approach will lead to some incredible beers, and we hope you are eager to help us try some of them.- Ben, Lester, and Mike",2015,AQhqDf,Barebottle Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.barebottlebeer.com

Tom’s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete’s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer – and specifically micro-brews – have contributed to Tom’s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.)

"Since 2003, family and friends have come to know that initials on the bottle caps along with names of classic cars designate beers from the Barley and Vine Brewery.   Barley and Vine is becoming known for great quality ales, and at times going to extremes to provide the very best in beer.

From the first batch of beer, Rambler Red, brewing was destined for the garage or outdoors because of the huge mess and bad smell made in the kitchen. So, for the first four years Barley and Vine was making 5-gallon extract batches.  Barley and Vine began sharing the beers with friends and family looking for input and making corrections and changes when needed.  As time went by the brewing skill level and quality of the beer continued to improve.   Changing from 5-gallon extract batched to 10 gallon all-grain batches made a huge difference in the quality of the final product.

Barley and Vine is a nano brewery in the planning.  As we continue to build our business plan, determine a location, and perfect our recipes and processes we will do our best to keep people up to speed through this website, Facebook, and our blog.

As you turn off Ramada Drive and onto Marquita Way, you will meander around a majestic oak tree.  This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree’s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery…well, that’s our story at Barrelhouse and we can’t exactly prove it, but we’re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.  We think it makes a sweet logo, too!

"Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is Williamsport's first production brewery since the 1950's. The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.",,lfsNEt,Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com

"Beaverhead Brewing Company is owned and operated by Brett Maki.

Brett was born and raised in Dillon.  His brewing career started in Seattle in 2001 with a homebrew kit his wife purchased for him for his birthday, three short months later he found himself working for Pyramid Brewery in Seattle, making soda, driving forklift, and washing tanks.  There he learned the trade of cellar work and brewing beer.

When Pyramid closed its doors in Seattle, Brett moved on to work for a small brewery in south Seattle.  He soon became head brewer and was put in charge of training new employees and developing new beers.

In 2011 he and his family moved back to Dillon, there the town needed a brewer and Brett needed a brewery.

The name for Beaverhead Brewing Company comes from the original brewery in Dillon which operated in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s.  Little is known about the original Beaverhead Brewery (Dillon Brewery) but newspaper clipping mention it was regarded as making the “Finest Beer.”  Owned and operated at one time by Henry Burfiend and his brother, the Brewery closed in 1919 at the start of Prohibition.  The Brewery was located on the south side of Dillon near where the medical clinic is located today.",,lX2XWI,Beaverhead Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.beaverheadbeer.com/

"Berghoff’s history as a beer brand goes back over 120 years, and in that time it has developed a reputation of high quality and consistency. The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman’s desire to expand the market for the family’s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World’s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           

   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff’s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.",1887,nJjPsG,"Berghoff Brewery, Inc",False,brewery,http://berghoffbeer.com/

During our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.

You can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you’re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible.

The abbey owned several bars in the area and produced lager under its own ""Trappist"" brand as well as contract brewing for several private labels. In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel.

"All over the United States, craft breweries are continuing an American tradition which experienced an almost 50 year drought after the repeal of prohibition. Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new “microbreweries” all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.
Until 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town’s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery’s demise.
Big Muddy Brewing’s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago’s Rosati’s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.
It was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.
Stuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.
Stuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.
The first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg’s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good “craft beer transition brew” for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).
Kinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing’s second selection, “Saluki Dunkel Dog”, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.
The third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing’s lineup is an ale called “Big Muddy Pale Ale”, and future varieties include “Logan’s Lager”.",2009,oBe8dQ,Big Muddy Brewing Co,False,brewery,http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/

Our heritage yeast is housed in a special yeast laboratory to ensure the consistency and freshness of our brews.

Anxious to try his new design, he promptly flew and crashed the plane, demolishing it.  He redesigned and successfully flew his plane, possibly making him the first person in Fort Wayne to fly on his own.  This earned him the name Birdboy.  After making a name for himself locally, Birdboy travelled the country and the world, all the while updating and refining his design.  He became a huge influence on aviation throughout the world, and Smith Field here in Fort Wayne is named after him.

"Beer is an art and Drive Beer knows it well. Starting from this assumption, in 1999 The Tarricone Family takes over a factory, built in the '80es upon instruction of HM the Prince of Windisgraetz of the Austrian Family of Furstenberg who then bought the Prinz Brau Group. Later, in the '90es, this latter was acquired together with the Birra Moretti Group, by the Labatt Group.
In the next years, the Moretti-Prinz Brau Group was acquired by Interbrau and eventually by Heineken.
The entire know-how and the workers themselves have been kept by Drive Beer, thus assuring a continuity in the excellence of the brands produced. 
The art of manufacturing fermented products and yeasts management is in the DNA of the Tarricone Family. Precisely, in the first years of 1900, the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone owned several vineyards and produced an excellent wine. He was producing and selling his wine all across the inland of Lucania transporting it on his picturesque chariots drawn by horses. 
He then moved the company office to Atella (PZ), and then to Bella (PZ), and eventually, bewitched by the beautiful landscape and the extraordinary nature of the surroundings of Muro Lucano (PZ), he settled down, together with his entire family of Corato origins, he married a Muro Lucano girl, whose name was Concetta Bianchini.
Therefore, when in 1999 the Tarricone Family was suggested by Gerardo, one of the sons of the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone, to take over the Brewery, belonging to the Heineken Group, it was almost physiological to the five brothers, Giuseppe, Vito, Carlo, Federico e Fabrizio, who at that time were expanding their businesses linked somehow to the food and beverages sectors, to accept this ""challenge"", which represented for the Tarricone Family a ""return to the origins"".
The Drive Beer, an industry of the national market, has managed to impose itself as a beer pole, entirely Italian, competing with the most famous multinational companies.
Finally, the Company, based on the remarkable approvals made by operators, has then invested time and resources by recurring to the skills of expert advisors for realising an distributing the products.",1999,sBUp7v,Birra Morena,True,brewery,http://www.birramorena.com

"Bitter Old Fecker Rustic Ales, based in Chelsea, Michigan, is a small batch brewery started by Nathan Hukill, an entrepreneur with an ideal lineage for brewing craft beer. His great grandparents were bootleggers in Detroit, running booze from Canada, who also ran a blind pig speakeasy out of their basement. Detroit police (including the Chief) were their main clientele. His great grandmother also made beer in her kitchen for the guys at the brickyard where she worked.

Nathan's grandfather Cecil -- rail worker, 17-year Ford employee turned weird angry recluse -- left Detroit for Hillsdale, MI to start farming. Cecil started brewing in the early 80's, naming beers after the things that inspired the recipes and included ingredients he grew or foraged. 

After some frustration with trying to break into brewing, Nathan started Bitter Old Fecker, working under Cecil as an apprentice. During the start up process, Nathan took a job as an assistant brewer at Grizzly Peak, leaving after 18 months to focus efforts on Bitter Old Fecker exclusively. 

Nathan and Cecil produce high gravity, bold beers brewed in a ""rustic"" style. No automatic equipment. Kettles, mash tuns, etc., stirred by hand in a brewery that can literally produce beer without the use of electricity. All beers are barrel-aged and include non traditional, foraged and locally sourced ingredients. All malt and hops are 100% US grown. His first brew, introduced in the Summer of 2013, is called Strutter, named after a nasty old rooster on Cecil's farm.

"Black Creek Historic Brewery recreates the techniques, tools and recipes used by brewers in 1860s Ontario. Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.

In the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.

The equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!

Visitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you’ll be tasting the authentic flavours of ales and porters made by hand, using only natural ingredients and genuine period recipes.

"Black Hog Brewing started with the story of food, family, and a love for craft beer. Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason’s wedding to his son’s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! 

Black Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types.

Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success.

"Bloom Brew is co-owned by Jeff Bloom and Steve Denk. Jeff and Steve have a combined 8 years of home-brewing experience which is now being embodied by Bloom Brew's exquisite repertoire of craft beers! 
What started out as a hobby quickly grew into an obsession...                              
 The founder's story - Jeff Bloom
  Steve & I met through work and our common interest in brewing was immediately apparent. Everything we initially brewed together came out of my home kitchen. Soon enough, we were asked to participate in some non-profit beer shows, starting with our first invitation from Barks & Brews of the Beaver County Humane Society -  we were immediately hooked! People loved our beer and kept asking us where they could buy it. At first we explained we were just home brewers and couldn't sell it, but could only give it away at non-profit events. Finally, in February 2013, we had a change of heart, took the leap and decided to open our own brewery - thus, Bloom Brew was born.
  With a lot of hard work and a ton of sweat equity, Bloom Brew now has a place to call our own. Our brewery is located at 100 Riverside Dr, in West Newton, Pennsylvania (USA). We share space with the West Newton Volunteer Fire Department and are proud to say we have developed a beer exclusively to benefit this fire-hall, which we call 82 Hot Head Red, and 10% of all sales of this beer will benefit them!
  All of our beers are handcrafted in small batches using as many local ingredients as possible. We have a two-acre fruit orchard, raise our own bees and grow some of our own hops - so the ingredients in our beer are also home-grown! Further, we process 90% of the fruit we use by hand!  We're serious about our beer and our brewing and have 24 beers on draft at all times.  When those kick, we are always ready to have an additional 24 to put on tap! That's makes a total of 48 different beers you can experience at our brewery. 
  We may be small but our beer will speak for itself. This is a dream come true for Steve and I . 
We love our craft and you will love our beer!",2013,1eZ4v8,Bloom Brew,False,brewery,http://bloombrew.com/
"Philosophy—
Life without labor is guilt. 
Labor without art is brutality—John Rusgan

There is a nearly infinite variety of ways to make good beer. At the Bloomington Brewing Company, we make beers that we like to drink. That’s the first rule. Great ingredients and attention to detail is the second. Our intention is not to grow a large brewery operation, our intention is to make great beer that we like to drink and to take care of our community.

We make only ales and they are available only on draft in Bloomington, Indianapolis and the surrounding communities. We do not bottle our beers. We’re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap. Often it will be not nearly as good. Why? Draft beer is fresher; that’s a big one. Packaging beer is a complicated process with lots of potential for bad things to happen.

"Dave and Donny Firth started brewing beer like most folks do, with a microbrew kit. While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren’t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed — their family’s, friend’s, friends of friend’s, friends of friends of friend’s, the occasional enemy’s, and their own — and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience — kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone’s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.

Eventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don’t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.

What was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole’-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they’re converted into what look like out-houses (don’t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage — an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.",,xaBLno,Booze Brothers Brewing Co.,False,brewery,http://boozebrothersbrewery.com/

With over 85 breweries in San Diego in January of 2013, we knew that we wanted to add our own unique contribution to the beer scene. Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.

"Today, we're a team of about 750 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams beers to beer lovers everywhere. We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.

Jim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.

One of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: ""What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?""

Each year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

"Boxcar Brewing Company is a community-oriented brewing company providing fine crafted beer to be enjoyed with family and friends.
The idea for Box Car Brewing Company originated in 2006 in Tennessee at the wedding of two of its chief members Jason and Kristen Kohser. In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason’s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked “homebrews” prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He’s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason’s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these “homebrews”. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.

A few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live. Together with the other three members the idea was hatched to get serious and start brewing beer on a larger scale, for the beer lovers in Chester County, PA.

"With necessity being the mother of invention…Bozeman Brewing was born.

Let us explain…

When Todd Scott met his future wife Lisa Danzl while both were working and playing in Yellowstone National Park in 1986, they conceived a dream together: To one day live off the land. It was a dream inspired by a trip to Alaska and a love for the outdoors, and one day, darn it, they were going to make it happen.

The couple moved to Tahoe, where Todd put his culinary degree to work as a sous chef while they skied. It was here that they decided it was time to become self-sufficient. Todd had every intention of making their own soap, toothpaste, even toilet paper. But one thing haunted him… he didn’t want to live without beer. He had no choice; the first step was to learn how to make his own. And that was also the last step.

Todd’s natural knack for home brewing, made with borrowed equipment, quickly trumped the couple’s off-the-grid dreams. And let’s just say that Lisa wasn’t all that disappointed…now she didn’t have to use the homemade toilet paper for starters, but she also got to drink some damn good beer. Todd and Lisa had never tasted such fine brew, and they knew they were on to something special.

That was just the beginning of the journey towards Bozone beer. The rest goes something like this…

Todd refined his beer making skills for a brewery in Calistoga, while working another job and taking classes on the art and science of beer fermentation at UC Davis. But all the while, Montana beckoned.

Todd scored a job as the head brewer for Spanish Peaks in Bozeman―a position he held for 10 years―and Lisa worked for the City. When Spanish Peaks moved production to California, Todd and Lisa knew it was time to bring their own fine brews to the beer drinkers of Bozeman. They bought the equipment and opened the doors to the Bozeman Brewing Company warehouse in 2001, on the edge of Bozeman’s historic Brewery District on the north side.

There, Bozeman Brewing’s flagship beer, Bozone Select Amber Ale (based on a recipe that Todd had perfected over the years), made its way to the beer drinkers of Montana and beyond. Today, the same warehouse rotates more than 4 seasonal ales and lagers, along with the regulars Hopzone IPA, Plum Street Porter and Bozone Hefeweizen, all on tap in the Bozone tasting room.

And today, Bozone beers have truly become a Montana state of mind…",2001,MEZupX,Bozeman Brewing Co,False,brewery,http://www.bozemanbrewing.com/

With initially only a small amount of money available to them (200.000Bfr, less than 5.000€), they started out on what the fans of the brewery call the ‘Chouffe story’. 

At the beginning its founders thought of it as a hobby, but the brewery developed at such a rate that, one by one, they decided to devote themselves to the adventure full-time. The first ‘brassin’ (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982.

The elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our ‘nectar’ from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.

"In 1890 the Allard family founded the Brunehaut brewery in Guignies, then called the St Joseph Brewery. It became known in the region for brewing beers like ""La Druide"" and ""Brunehaut 8°"". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as ""grand crus"" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!
These are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.

Tradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.

Modern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.

"The French Flemish County brewery was launched in November 2006. At the beginning, it was just a game between two best friends: Olivier Duthoit and Mathieu Lesenne. But now, a great adventure has started and our company is now well established.

Our Brewery is located in Blaringhem, a small village on the border between old Flemish County and the Artesian one. We are proud of our roots and we like to highlight them. And which product can best illustrate the friendship and conviviality of people from the North of France: beer of course ! This is one of the reasons why all of our raw materials come from surrounding areas.

Our site has a long history. Indeed, at the beginning of the 20 th century, the place where the brewery is located , was a large distillery. The 2 world wars ended the business of this industry but today, our brewery is really proud to give these walls a new soul.

The production line also has a great history. As a matter of fact, our brewery tanks were firstly implemented in a Canadian micro brewery. Then, they were imported to Lorraine by a French brewer. Since the production line was taken over in 2008, Olivier and Mathieu have added some other tanks and tools to improve the capacity and the quality of their beers.

Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only ""The people's beverage"", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

Pinkus Müller is a German brewery based in the Northern Germany town of Münster. The Pinkus-Müller brewery traces its origins to the arrival of Johannes Müller (1792–1870) in Münster from his home town of Hildebrandshausen in 1816. After marrying Friederika Cramer they opened a bakery and a brewery. In 1866 the bakery was closed and a malthouse was opened instead. In the following hundred years the brewery and the pub were expanded. In 1993 a bottling plant was opened in the neighbouring city of Laer. It is the only brewery left in Münster from original 150 breweries.,1816,dWrNma,Brauerei Pinkus Müller,False,brewery,http://pinkus.de/

"During the period of promoterism – at the end oft he 19th century – the breweries in Cologne sprang up like mushrooms. In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – then called OBERGÄRIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) – was founded in the Cologne quarter “Severinsviertel” in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Reißdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich – today a quarter of Bergheim/Erft – as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name Kölsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called “Wiess”. After Heinrich’s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Reißdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Reißdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Reißdorf.

When the product range was diversified to further styles of beer – Märzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen – in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich’s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Reißdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a “Einfachbier” (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation.

Due to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.

"At Braxton, a garage is more than a garage. It’s a place where we build our hopes and dreams, storing them on the wall neat as garden tools. Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.

We hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You’ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say “Yes, sir.” You can almost smell the oil and beer.

But more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It’s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.

For Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan’s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He’s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it’s a pretty extraordinary family.)

So welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You’re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It’s a great deal of work, but hell, that’s what makes a dream worth pursuing.

"The world of beer is increasingly one of two extremes.  While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds – beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. 

What’s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.

While German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.

"ABOUT BBNo.
Our history, our future and what drives Brew By Numbers.
THE BEER

At Brew By Numbers (BBNo.) we strive to create new, exciting and forward-thinking beers focusing on quality and drinkability. Whether developing new styles, adapting established ones, or bringing the less well-known styles back into the limelight, we create each beer with the same level of care, attention and respect.
All of these carefully crafted beers are brewed with the finest natural ingredients and packaged alive, in both bottle and KeyKeg, to ensure a natural carbonation and allow flavours to evolve over time. The harshest critics of our own work, we only release beers that are of a high standard, balanced and drinkable.

 

THE INSPIRATION

Before brewing together, Dave and Tom took their inspiration from opposite sides of the world.  Dave discovered craft beer in Australia and New Zealand, while Tom, introduced to The Kernel Brewery during the early days, was blown away by the intensity and variety of flavours that come from the new world hops they were using.

Since brewing together, Tom and Dave took a trip to Belgium for the Festival of Spontaneous Fermentation – a weekend dedicated to Gueuze and Lambic beers – and were taken aback by the refreshing crispness of Belgian Saisons and the funky acidity created by the wild yeast Brettanomyces, intrigued by the herbal and spicy tartness of Witbiers, and blown away by the rich complexity of the Abbey style ales.

Brew By Numbers continues to draw inspiration from other breweries in the States and the UK as well as taking inspiration from flavour combinations from everyday life.

 

THE BEGINNING

Tom and Dave met in China on a rock climbing tour around Asia.  After hanging out on the rocks and riding motorbikes around Vietnamese islands and the hilly borderlands between Laos and Myanmar they formed a solid friendship.

In April 2011, Dave returned from travelling after two years in the Antipodes, drinking craft beer and doing some basic homebrew.  At the same time, Tom – an old friend of Toby from the Kernel – was drinking their IPAs and Pale Ales, wondering how he could do them differently.

By August that year Dave and Tom, committed to opening their own microbrewery, had secured the use of a friend’s basement on Southwark Bridge Road and built a simple homebrew kit.  Through reading books on brewing, researching online, and asking for tips and advice from friends in the industry, Dave and Tom began to teach themselves to brew.

The first three brews were made with malt extract, boiled with hops to give flavour and bitterness, and fermented in plastic buckets.  From brew 4 onwards Dave and Tom moved to all-grain mashes, using malted grains instead of extract to achieve more authentic results.

Their set-up was rudimentary: a 50ltr coolbox with homemade copper manifold and sparge arm and a plastic container for both hot liquor (water) tank (HLT) and boil kettle.  But results were good, and by brews 6 and 7 people were seeing potential.

Dave and Tom progressed quickly.  This was, in part, because they would split batches at different stages to create variations of each brew – whether at the boil to allow different hop and spice additions, in the fermentor to allow the use of different yeasts, or post-fermentation to allow the use of dry hopping, infusions or wild yeasts.  By doing this, original recipes and methods were developed.

In February 2012 a French Saison yeast strain was brought to London for a collaboration brew between two prominent UK brewers.  That strain gradually made its way around London’s breweries, finally reaching Dave and Tom, and by brew 20 they made their first Citra Saison.  Now officially Brew By Numbers, Dave and Tom took this ‘Hoppy Saison’ to the staff at Craft Beer Co. Clerkenwell for their critique.

June 2012 and Dave and Tom visited Belgium with Andy from Partizan Brewing (then still brewing at Redemption) and Toby from the Kernel.  Upon returning, inspired by the trip, BBNo. brewed their first Brett-aged Saison and began planning to brew Witbiers and Belgian Blonde Ales.

In July 2012 a generous philanthropist donated enough money for Dave and Tom to move to stainless equipment – for HLT/kettle and mash tun, at least.  This investment allowed many upgrades that would help BBNo. achieve their goal of selling beer brewed in their basement space.

They achieved that goal when in November 2012 they received permission from Southwark Council to brew beer for sale and on December 1st hosted the official launch party of Brew By Numbers at The Craft Beer Co. in Clerkenwell.

 

THE BREWHOUSE

With the recent flourish of microbreweries in the UK the demand for and cost of used brewhouses is high.  BBNo. was faced with two options: spend a lot on a small, second-hand brewhouse, or create our own.  The choice was easy, so inspired by the craft breweries of Australia and New Zealand – where brewery-specific equipment is scarce – we decided to convert used stainless soft drink and dairy vessels to create our own bespoke brewhouse.

BBNo.’s brewhouse has one of the smallest footprints of any 12 barrel (bbl) brewery in the UK, with a gravity fed whirlpool allowing the brewers to use hop pellets in the boil for maximum flavour extraction.  The cladding and banding were all done by hand, in-house, with the help of some volunteers.

Now the brewhouse is finished, the old tanks are ready to enjoy their latest incarnation, making some of the finest beer south of the river.

 

THE PILOT KIT

Experimentation has always been a mainstay of our approach to brewing.  With the 12bbl brewhouse up and running our original brew kit has become our pilot kit.  On this kit we develop new ideas and recipes, testing new ingredients and creating short-run, limited-release batches.

The pilot kit is one tenth the size of our new brewhouse, making the upscaling of recipes quite simple.  Furthermore, wort from the large brewhouse can be collected and used to create different recipe variations.  From brewing Imperial versions of the main batch to creating a series of Coffee Porters, this flexibility allows us to push the boundaries of our understanding and continually extend our knowledge.

Keep an eye out for the red Pi stamp indicating these exclusive new brews.

 

THE LOCATION

BBNo. HQ stands shoulder to shoulder with other artisan producers in the heart of Bermondsey’s culinary quarter, a stone’s throw from the popular Maltby Street Market and Spa Terminus.

 

OPEN DAYS AND EVENTS

"Welcome to Brewer’s Alley, Frederick, Maryland’s first Brewpub. Brewer’s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.

Brewer’s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer’s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer’s Alley is back!

Brewer’s Alley’s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.

In 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the ""new"" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer’s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it’s kind in town.

As the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick’s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick’s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith’s film ""The Birth of a Nation"", and the Manhattan Opera Company’s production of ""Madame Butterfly"", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.

Brewer’s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland’s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.

We are most happy to oversee the building’s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.

"We are proud to announce the recent opening of Brewery Rickoli, The Premier Brewery in Wheat Ridge Colorado, serving freshly brewed craft beer and offering a relaxed and friendly space to gather. We are located by the Southwest corner of 44th Ave. and Wadsworth Blvd.

Our take on beer is simple – Use great ingredients and brew for flavor!  Rickoli’s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That’s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it’s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.

Our Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That’s not to say you won’t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick’s special brews!

We’re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli’s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.

"Brewery Terra Firma is unique in its approach as a brewery and as an agricultural destination. Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.

The BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.

The prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.

Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.
 
It is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .

We are 14th generation cider makers and since 1658 when uncle Gabriel first sold his barrels around Wells, Shepton Mallet and Glastonbury, our family have always striven to make light, refreshing ciders using pears and strawberries as well as apples.

Things really got going for us as a business when in 1995 we took our Pear Cider to the Glastonbury Festival and sold it from our bar by the Jazz Stage. It went down so well that we kept going back year after year.

Ten years later to meet demand for Pear Cider all year round we bottled a small batch and sold it from our factory and on our website. Word spread and soon local pubs began to buy Brothers.

"Harrisonburg, VA is and always has been our home, so where better to open a brewery than in our own backyard? Well, maybe our taproom/brewing facility isn’t literally in our backyard – in fact we renovated a soda bottling plant to suit all of our production needs – but with such a close-knit and supportive community, every inch of Virginia feels like home.

Brothers Craft Brewing (originally Three Brothers Brewing) was founded by the three Shifflett siblings, who used their collective experience to execute a singular vision: brew exciting, unique craft beers that emphasize and support our community.

It didn’t take long to realize that same community was our extended family. The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.

When thinking about the people we’ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.

Despite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we’ve gained so much family already?

When we started this endeavor, we couldn’t have possibly imagined the growth we’ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we’ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we’ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.

"Like most things, there are various ways to make mead. At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:

1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.

2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.

3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.

4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.

5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.

6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.

These basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!",,IEFRaK,Brothers Drake Meadery,False,brewery,http://brothersdrake.com/

"Eight generations ago, in 1809, the Lindemans family owned a farm in Vlezenbeek near Brussels. They decided to intensify Lambic brewing activities during winter, when less farm work had to be done.

"The Brewery Oud Beersel, which started in 1882, is located in Beersel at 10 km from the Brussels city centre, in the southwest of the capital. It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods.

Lambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora.

Due to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations.

This traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the métier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the métier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality.

Thanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.",1882,EFaa8I,Brouwerij Oud Beersel,False,brewery,http://www.oudbeersel.com/

"In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander, Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach's until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.",1821,qZJOHj,Brouwerij Rodenbach,False,brewery,http://www.rodenbach.be/

"Amandus Van Honsebrouck, born in 1811, farmer and mayor of Werken, starts the first brewery around 1850 in Werken.
Emile, his son, takes over and moves to Ingelmunster in 1900 and founds the St-Josef brewery.
Emile’s sons, Paul and Ernest, take over and expand firmly. In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager.
Luc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia.
Luc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on ‘old Flemish brown’, Bacchus.
In 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.
In 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer’s uprising against French occupation in 1798.
In 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched. It starts with ‘Donker’, than ‘Tripel’, ‘Rouge’ and ‘Blond’.
In 2009, the 5th generation, Xavier Van Honsebrouck, takes over.
His first achievement is the ‘Cuvée du Château’.
In 2012 the high exclusive Trignac follows and in 2013 Kasteel Hoppy.
In commemoration of a 100 years World War I, ‘Passchendaele’, a Belgian Top Blond, with only 5.2° alcohol is launched in 2013. A donation is offered to the community of Zonnebeke, to contribute in the preservation of its remnants of the Great War.

"Viven was originally founded in 1999 by Willy De Lobel and was called Chapel of Viven, the blonde, and Monastery of Viven, the brown. The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of professionals that could brew his recipe.

His journey ended when he found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called “De Proefbrouwerij”. There Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven. 

In 2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.

Since then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.

In 2009 the time was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA. These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible to a wider audience of beer lovers.",1999,fJ4TNq,Brouwerij Van Viven,False,brewery,http://www.viven.be/

"The story begins in old Europe; Transylvania.

Our beer recipe has been refined over the centuries in lands with pure streams of water and gold fields of barley, by our ancestors who still tell old stories that became legends. In Transylvania, (the land of Dracula) vampires and werewolves were facts of life, not just creatures that you find in books and movies.

Our ancestry can be traced back to the brew master of a village, located on the high plateaus of the Carpathian Mountains. The village is surrounded by Dark Forest. No full moon would pass without the village losing at least one maiden to the creatures of the Dark Forest. Words like “vampire” or “werewolf” were never spoken aloud, as it was believed that by simply uttering the word would bring about the loss of a family member.

Our beer became famous, not only for its rich taste, rich flavor and freshness, but for its legend. As the story goes, one night, under the full moon, the brew master left a full jar of fresh beer outside on his porch to cool from the night breeze. He fell asleep and forgot about the jar of fresh beer he had left on the porch.

The next morning, as the custom was, the villagers gathered and to their surprise, they realized that for the first time for as long as they could remember, no maiden had been taken the night before. Moments later, the brew master stormed in, demanding someone claim responsibility for the missing jar of beer! From that night onward, a fresh jar of beer is left out under each full moon and no maiden has been lost since.

Nowadays, some internet-surfing, smartphone-addicted youngsters claim that this is just an old story and the brew master was probably the one who drank the beer, and the king’s knights are responsible for driving away the creatures that lurked in the Dark Forest. But no one dares to go outside under the full moon, and the jar of beer still disappears each night.

We make our beer religiously following our ancestor’s recipe: fresh barley, hops and secret ingredients from the Old Country. The beer that you are drinking is in its purest form, being hand-crafted in our breweries and kept fresh and cold following simple, natural processes. There are no chemicals or preservatives used. Taste our beer and you will understand why no maiden has been lost for more than two centuries.",,KQDQgO,Brownstone Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://brownstonebrewing.com

"The story of Brüeprint Brewing Company begins five years ago in a family kitchen in Holly Springs, North Carolina. It’s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the “blueprint” for great beer was born! Eric’s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.

Better than a recipe, a brewing “blueprint” combines science and great culinary skill to create a Brüeprint.

It’s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery—Brüeprint Brewing Company.

"Bruggsmidjan ehf. was established in December 2005, so the company is very young but it has gone through a lot of changes and has been enlarged twice since it was opened. The idea of making a mini brewery came from two people in Árskogssandur, the couple Agnes Anna and Olafur Trostur, after Agnes saw a small news report on Icelandic television. The report was about growing popularity of small breweries in Denmark, and a week later they were in Denmark to see breweries. Early in 2006 they found investers and today there are 15 individuals who share 44% of the company, and Agnes and Olafur own 56%.

The idea for Agnes and Olafur was to make a new brand of beer to sell, and they only wanted to make a beer which had high quality and rich taste, so they chose to use a Czech tradition beacause beers from Czech Republic are known for their good quality. Agnes and Olafur had two options of making the beer, they could either find a beer that they liked and buy the recipe and make the beer in Iceland, or make the choice they did. They hired a brewmaster named David Masa, a brewmaster from Czech and he has studied brewing for 9 years but the standard education is 4 years. They made their own beer from their ideas of good beer. They decided to make high quality beer, and use only the best raw materials they could get. They get all the materials from Czech Republic exept of course the Icelandic fresh water wich they get from a mountain in Arskogssandur.

The outcome  is Kaldi. An Icelandic beer, brewed by a Czech recipe and has only the best materials. The beer has no added sugar or any preservatives, an Kaldi is not pasteurized. All this makes Kaldi as fresh and healthy as he can possibly be.

In the beginning Kaldi was producedin 170.000 lt. per year. But due to very good sale of the beer and lot of requests , they had to add fermentation tanks and after that, Kaldi was produced in 300.000 lt. per year.

"Our story begins with two guys, Nate and Erik. Both had been home brewing for years, and started brewing together in their back yards in the summer of 2010. The goal of the first brews was to make enough beer for Nate’s upcoming wedding. In the ensuing months the two continued brewing on a regular basis, creating better beers, refining the equipment and process and devising some great new recipes. As they continued to brew together, talk turned to the idea of an eventual commercial venture.

TJ, a mutual friend of the two brewers noted that he could provide some equipment to allow for some larger brewing projects. Having this greater capacity led to the realization, that as much fun as it might be to try, the three of them would not be able to drink nearly as much as they were certain to produce and the beer would have to be shared with the public. The wheels were officially set in motion to make the jump from hobbyists to professional brewers.

To round out the team, the trio turned to some other friends. Drew had joined in on the occasional brewing session, and one of his creations took home a prize at a local brewing competition. Ron brought to the table the business and accounting skills needed to make this a business. Five friends who enjoyed hanging out together had just hit on the magic formula to turn fun into a business.

Bucket opened its pilot brewery in the Lorraine Mills in Pawtucket. The space was a 375 square foot room, and the equipment was largely retooled and designed to create a 1 BBL brewery. The first keg of beer went on tap in November 2012 and within a couple of months it was clear that the demand was huge and a bigger brewery would be needed.

In June of 2013, the pilot brewery closed and construction began on a full scale production brewery in August. Located in the mill at 545 Pawtucket Avenue, the new space was nearly 10 times larger at 3400 square feet. With a 10 BBL brewhouse, the production capacity grew ten-fold as well.

In the Fall of 2013, brewing began in the new facility and in November, Bucket Brewery was officially opened to the public. In addition to the kegs of beer that were the exclusive packaging in the pilot site, Bucket started shipping beer in 64oz and 32oz containers.

The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...

The town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of ""Burleigh Inn"", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).

As for the product, I'm no zymologist, but I'll try to do the microbrews justice. I chose to review the Black Nail Stout and the Radiator Dip Pale Ale – partly because they are so different.
Although I enjoyed the flavor of the stout, it wasn't my favorite. My initial impression was bitterness and it was difficult for me to get beyond that and actually taste the beer. A second sample of the brew allowed me to recognize the rich flavor and the hint of coffee flavoring.

Beers were brewed on Sunday mornings, where biscuity malt and hop aromas would waft through their house waking up their two other housemates. Before too long they realised they wanted to brew these beers every day of the week and share their passion of brewing and drinking good beer with the rest of London.

Recipes were put together, brewing vessels were purchased, an industrial premises was let and the brewery in Summerstown, London, was born. Alex Bull and Chris Mills, the co-founders, had put together a microbrewery based in South-West London which created small-batch full-flavoured ales. Initially, four flagship ales were brewed for cask ale and bottles, with new on-off limited edition beers being created every month.

Within 18 months of operation the brewery was expanded with new vessels installed and a Brewery Tap was added. The expansion enabled keg beers to be produced, including a variety of lagers and stronger craft keg beers, with our Brewery Tap serving our beers directly from where they are brewed.­
We now produce four flagship ales and at least three varying seasonal ales every month.

"Cahaba Brewing Company was founded in the summer of 2011 by a group of friends united by their love of craft beer and home brewing.  They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham – Alabama.

The group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it’s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.

From the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.

Cahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating ""Last Pint Night"" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.",2011,63i9qL,Cahaba Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://cahababrewing.com/

Jörg Finkeldey, a South African trained Chemical Engineer worked most of his adult life in the brewing trade specifically in designing and selling micro brewing equipment from Upsala in  Sweden to Cape Town South Africa – from Costa Rica to Noumea in New Caledonia in the South Pacific. 

Jörg returned home to his country to grow up his two American born boys , Miko and Max and together with his Namibian wife Ulla managed to raise the required funds to start the Micro Brewery in Namibia. 
He chose a Namibian indigenous acacia erioloba better known as the Camelthorn Tree symbolizing the endurance and spirit of surviving the worst of droughts.

The early brewing pioneers resemble the resilience of the Camelthorn and we shall continue this quest for endurance and survival.” The first beer was tapped on 8/8/2009 exactly one year after acquiring a brewing licence the first to be awarded since the 1920’s.

"Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was founded in January of 2013 by Jason Stengl and Brian Hutchinson.  Jason and Brian met in 2004 at the Mountain Sun family of breweries in Boulder, Colorado were they both learned to hone the craft they love.  With over 15 years of combined professional brewing experience and an uncanny ability to tolerate one another, they decided it was time to take a leap and chase the dream of opening their own brewery.

With both Jason and Brian calling Golden, Colorado home, the choice for a location was obvious.  After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.  After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek.  The historical significance paired with the duo’s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.

Knowing that they wouldn’t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.

"Cascade Brewing Company was established in 1998 by Art Larrance, who has been involved in Oregon's craft beer industry since its inception. Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. 

Cascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. 

Together, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. 

Cascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

"Chandeleur (""shan-duh-leer"") Brewing Company was started by Cammack Roberds and Cain Roberds. Their love of beer began in the 90’s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.

They chose the name ""Chandeleur"" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.

Cam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they’re not brewing beer, you’re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.

As they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.

In December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.",2015,nJFd7Y,Chandeleur Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.chandeleurbrew.com/

In Italian immigrant Pete Prichard's effort to support his family, he came up with the idea of using an Indian Territory recipe to brew a beverage for the coal miners.

Pete's idea led to trouble during Prohibition. He was convicted, not once but twice, for breaking the federal Prohibition Act.

Prohibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla.

Those customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds.

"Cismontane Brewing Co. was started by two native southern Californians, Ross Stewart and Evan Weinberg. They chose the name Cismontane because the geographical area it represents, coastal Southern California from Santa Barbara to San Diego. As a brewery we are dedicated to creating the finest beers to represent the unique culture and diverse natural aspects of this region. Each beer is named after a local feature that is unique to the area.

The Brewery is located on the side of the largest mountain in Orange County in the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. The great views from Santiago peak and the trails through the canyons provide some of the natural inspiration for the beers and the company.

The brewery is small and accessible to all with a warm and comfortable tasting area. So don’t hesitate to come by when in the area.

"Clouds Brewing was built in the summer of 2014 with the idea of being a technologically advanced bar that caters to the crowds of downtown Raleigh.  As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.

Located in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we’ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.

A bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite—the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and “Experience the Downpour!”

As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to ""The Man"". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.

"We are Rod Smith and Bill Collister. We have been working together for 13 years at Farason Corporation. www.farason.com We became friends quickly due partly for our love of engineering and automation, as well as, our love and passion for craft beers. Our favorite past time has been traveling around visiting craft breweries, brewpubs and taprooms together, along with our wives, for 10 years now. Rod took up home brewing 5 years ago and has become quite proficient at brewing delicious beers to the delight and enjoyment of his colleagues, friends, and family. Rod's talent for brewing and Bill's business experience seemed like a good match for a brewpub that would allow us to continue enjoying Rod's hobby to its fullest extent and share it with many more fellow craft brew enthusiasts. We expect the creation, operation, and continuing evolution of the brewpub to provide us another outlet for our passions by providing a quality product and environment in which to enjoy it, along with meeting and enjoying the company of many people with the same love and passion for high quality craft beer.

Originally we looked all over for a good location starting within a few miles of our homes and extending out as far as Columbia hoping for a place within reasonable driving distance from our homes. We believed the market would, to some extent, come to us. Over several months we looked at numerous potential sites and due to one reason or another couldn't find an acceptable location. We ran into floor restrictions, ceiling height issues, limited parking, zoning issues and unaffordable rent. When we eventually met and talked with David Doolittle, Doolittle Investments LLC, he showed us two potential sites in Columbia. David seemed very interested in bringing our type of business into Columbia and offered us reasonable lease pricing and an honest willingness to work with us to bring our dream of a microbrewery to reality. The drive is 35 minutes from our homes, but after considering the location as fairly equally distant between Lancaster and York (both of which have more than one brewery), and the fact we would be first in Columbia and nearby Marietta and Wrightsville, plus the proximity to Route 30, we were sold on the location. We have since discovered that Columbia Borough is quite willing to help us establish our business in their wonderful town. We are thankful and grateful for their assistance and cooperation and look forward to being a part of the community.

Our brewing equipment consists of a 5bbl brew kettle, a 5bbl mash tun, and a 5bbl hlt. We will have three 5bbl or larger fermenters. We are ale people so we will have blondes, pale ales, IPAs, Porters/Stoudts, bitters, and a variety of Belgian versions as well. We will open with 4 taps and gradually expand to 8.
We expect to open this winter, Nov/Dec., but that is dependent on receipt of the brewing equipment and completion of the site as tentatively scheduled. We will open quitely and plan for a more elaborate grand opening at a later date. This venture is a new experience for us and the people assisting us so we need to start out slowly.

"Cool Beer Brewing Company was founded in 1997 by Bobby Crecouzos. His ambition was simple: to brew only the highest quality beer, made with the best ingredients, using absolutely no preservatives, additives or chemicals.

From the beginning, Cool didn’t focus on marketing and promotions. The Company concentrated on the product and the brewing process. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, the once-tiny Brewery grew steadily as its Cool Beer brand became increasingly successful. So much so, Cool had to expand its operations a number of times.

But the commitment to quality never changed.

By 2003, Cool was sufficiently well-established for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer. Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.

Both Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no additives whatsoever, and be put through the Brewery’s advanced cold-filtration system that makes them two of the most refreshing and thirst-quenching beers available.

"COOP Ale Works began with a humble home brewer and a simple dream. The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.

 

With the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.

The outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you – the fan of COOP Ale Works – will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own. Thank you for your unwavering support and encouragement!",2008,cKudBu,COOP Ale Works,False,brewery,http://www.coopaleworks.com/

At that time there were no breweries, brew pubs or microbreweries in our area. A two week vacation to Nova Scotia was inspirational.

"The Cooperstown area had a significant impact on American Brewing. It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.

Traveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, ""The hop was King in those days!"" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would ""put up"" a dozen people from ""the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a ""vacation"" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.
Settled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.

Grandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.",1994,ybdwZK,Cooperstown Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.cooperstownbrewing.com/

The County Cider Company is located on Ontario’s island of Prince Edward County. Most famous for the giant sand dunes and golden beaches of Sandbanks Provincial Park, the County also enjoys a dramatic history.

Following the American Revolution of 1776 the Township of Marysburgh—home to the County Cider Co.—was one of many established for the settlement of United Empire Loyalists. Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.

conradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture. It features dramatic French doors, over-sized windows and veranda as well as a hipped roof.

Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.
    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising ""Brew your own beer"". He was immediately hooked.

"The name Croocked Moon is inspired by a graffiti drawing, I once saw a grinning moon. Its expression captured in many ways the philosophy I want to resist. This is also underlined by the name of the election. I want to create a brand with an attitude that is not afraid to push the limits and the current perception of what the actual individual beers represent. English ologists will notice the spelling error in the word ""Croocked"". This misspelling is because originally, that I was given webdomænet and because of a typo there had sneaked an extra ""c"" in. I wondered whether I should buy another domain name, but then decided that it actually fell very much in line with my philosophy about challenging the conventional way of perceiving the beers on: I want to signal a more aggressive and provocative attitude towards the conventional way put together on the beer.

The slogan ""Ergo Bibendum"", which loosely translated means ""why we drink"" is the old character and is used increasingly often by medical students when they are toast. The idea behind this slogan is simple. As a philosophy describes, I want to create beers that challenge and provoke, but simultaneously has a flavor that gives people reason to choose just one Croocked Moon when they want a beer, there is something beyond the usual.

"If you could be doing whatever you want right now, what would you be doing? For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be ""listening to live music and drinking craft beer."" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.
 
There was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.
 
It was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.
  
Everyday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running ""off the grid"" as well.
 
Ken, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!",2010,tE9Evu,Crossroads Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://crossroadsbrewingco.com/

"Humble beginnings gave way to lessons learned of brewing in the shadows of the residence hall; steering clear of the landlord and having your ass handed to you by the almighty dollar are now consumed by the glory bells of success and the daily grind - a dichotomy of sorts… Should a young madman have to bend and be Ned Beatty’d to sell and serve to please the public eye’s nerve endings from the very beginning? Not this time around.
 
A brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family’s, employees’ and customers’ drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery…Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.
 
Can true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man’s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to…A madman’s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.
 
True patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what “pour to the line” means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin…still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery… True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.
 
Some things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you’re done, you’ll either get it or you won’t.

"The Dark Star Brewing Company was born in 1994 in the cellar of The Evening Star Pub, in Brighton.   With a brew plant only marginally bigger than an enthusiastic home-brew kit the characteristic style of hoppy beers was developed and tried out on the willing guinea pigs at the bar.

Within a few hard working years it was obvious that the brewery could not keep up with the growing thirst of the Evening Star’s drinkers, yet alone the demand for its beers from other local pubs and beer festivals.

In 2001, the team emptied their piggy banks, cashed in any ISA’s, sold TV’s and dug around behind the sofa for loose change, to relocate the brewery to a new purpose-built, 15 brewers barrel brewery in Ansty, near Haywards Heath – some would argue this was the point the hobby started to become a proper business…some would anyway. A few years on, and once again the brewery was on the move, this time to a bigger site in Partridge Green, just south west of Horsham, West Sussex.

"De Struise Brouwers (DSB) is a small beer company currently located in Oostvleteren, Belgium. In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.

Owners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.

Upon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.

The company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning ""tough"". They render the name into English as ""The Sturdy Brewers"", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.

Following current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.

They have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.",2001,bjwFtZ,De Struise,False,brewery,http://struise.com/

"Dick Young started brewing as a home brewer in 1984 and sold homebrew supplies at his business, Northwest Sausage & Deli.  When he wasn’t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick’s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick’s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick’s Brewing Company became a reality.

Dick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, “I started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty”.   And we are all so grateful he was.

The brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick’s Beers were flying out the door.
In 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.

Dick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.

Today, the Dick’s Brew Crew is led by Dick’s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick’s legacy.  All of us here at Dick’s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.",1984,GC3a1f,Dick's Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://dicksbeer.com/

"The road to the creation of Dirty Hands Brewing began during those halcyon days of college where Grant (UCLA) and Phil (University of Utah/University of Wyoming) started developing an appreciation for great beer. They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, “The true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.”  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that’s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!

"The Doodle Brewing Company was started by Nick Vaughn in 2008. Nick graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, Nick got a call from the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.
So he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado’s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin’s love of nautical history.

Dry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.

In 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.

In September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock’s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter’s canoes and the area gained the nickname “Canoe Room,” which stuck.

Dry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock’s Amber Ale).

"Dubh Linn in Old Irish means ” The Dark Pool”. In ancient times the river Dodder made a pool before flowing into the Liffey. Here the Vikings decided to settle. The Dodder today is a memory and has long been confined as a subterranean river. The dark waters from this pool were the inspiration for Arthur Guinness’ “Perfect Pint.”

“Dublin” is an Anglicism of “Dubh Linn”. In the old script, ‘bh’ was written with a dot placed over the ‘b’ – thus appearing to be Dub Linn or Dublinn. The Norman-speaking English who arrived in Old Irish-speaking Ireland in 1169 omitted the “dot” (or sÃ©imhiÃº in Irish), and spelled the town’s name as ‘Dublin.’

Some have suggested that “Dublin” is of Scandinavian origin: “djÃºp lind” (“deep pond”). However, the name “Dubh Linn” pre-dates the arrival of the Vikings in Ireland, and the Old Norse name is simply the words “Dubh Linn” re-spelled as if they were Old Norse: Dyflinn (correctly pronounced “DUEV-linn’ ).

Therefore, we selected “Dubh Linn” as a way of tying two cultures together – the Scandinavian heritage of Northern Minnesota and the Irish traditions of fine spirits, good company, and a comfortable atmosphere you only find in a pub.",,aXjy5E,Dubh Linn Irish Brew Pub,False,brewery,http://www.dubhlinnpub.com/

"Dungarvan Brewing Company was launched in April 2010 after a couple of years spent researching, planning and developing by the four founders.
The philosophy of the brewery is one of purity — we keep the beer in its purest form by bottle-conditioning it. It isn’t filtered, isn’t pasteurised and is naturally carbonated so there is minimum interference with it between raw ingredients and finished product. We always start with the best quality ingredients including; Maris Otter malt, full leaf hop cones and the limestone rich water of West Waterford.
Our brewer strives for quality and consistency across every stage of the brew, working hard to ensure that each bottle achieves the high standards he has set. All the beers are craft brewed in small batches and by its artisan nature this can lead to slight variations by batch.
The brewhouse is a 6bbl plant made by PBC Brewery Installations, the UK’s top micro brewery installer and is ideally suited to the bottle-conditioned traditional ales that we brew.
Bottling is currently done by hand with a four-head filler with plans to upgrade this to an automated system in the coming months.",2010,vFrJjr,Dungarvan Brewing,False,brewery,http://dungarvanbrewingcompany.com

"E.C. Dahls Brewery (E.C. Dahls Bryggeri) is a brewery and soft drink factory based in Trondheim, Norway.

E.C. Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814–1882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (Sukkerhuset) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984.

The first bottle of Bayerøl, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well. Bayerøl was the most important type of beer until the early 20th century when Dahls Pils, a pilsener took over as the most popular beer.

In 1966, it was merged with Trondheim Akti Brewery (Trondhjems Aktiebryggeri), which was founded in 1899 and Trondheim Brewery (Trondhjems Bryggeri) which dated to 1919. E.C.

After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.

"The Elevator Brewer and Draught Haus finds its home in the historic Columbia building, built in 1897 by the Bott family to house the Bott Brother’s Billiards and a gentleman’s saloon.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling.

"Engine 15 Brewing Co. was born of the need for great beer!  Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a “beer kit” from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.

Fast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.

All that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch’s 1962 Ford Fire Engine – after all, they just don’t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.
As of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you’ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!

"The most common question we get is, why Equinox Brewing? The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there’s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple…

We find another aspect of beer’s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don’t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.

On one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We’re not afraid to try new things.

"Arriving in Madison, Wisconsin on May 11, 1852 from a village in Germany called Ichendorf, George Esser possessed little more than the clothing on his back, a talent for masonry, and a taste for good, traditional German beer. Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently the distributor of Esser's Best in the area.",1852,xHovlT,Esser's Cross Plains Brewery,False,brewery,http://www.essersbest.com/

In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot.

"Eventide is a start-up brewery in Atlanta, GA. It was founded on the idea that great beer doesn’t have to be complicated and good beer should be enjoyable. We are also focused on bringing sessionable craft beer to everyone. The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn’t have to be complicated.

Another of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open. So, with this in mind, we will share as many of our “secrets” as possible with everyone so that they too can make great beer at home. If you ever have questions please reach out, we are more than happy to share what we know!

"Farmington Brewing Company is the brainchild of two innovated scientists.   Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn’t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.

The Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  

Poor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  

The second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason’s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.

"Farnum Hill Ciders fulfill the true meaning of the word “cider” -- alcoholic beverages fermented from apples, exactly as wines are fermented from grapes.

In our tough conditions, these varieties produce intense, concentrated flavors and aromas not typical in their home regions.

"Faustino Microcervejeira is a production and trading company of Craft Beer. It produces several beers under various brand names that come to you with the utmost care and quality that we can.

As we only use particular beer ingredients, barley, hops, yeast and water, we obtain an end product which distinguishes itself from the soda flavor, the aroma, the gas and until the foam.

We also do not filter out our beer as it removes the same properties and with sterilization eliminates any living yeast. Did you know that in ancient times beer was the safest way to drink water? This is because beers have a long duration without spoiling due to microorganisms responsible for fermentation yeasts. These can overlap with agents that invade their surroundings, beer, killing them. Due to the lower alcohol content does not lead to dehydration as much as other alcoholic beverages. Thus one Brew is valid for drinking from about 1 year. The most interesting is that adequately conditioned beers, depending on the style, last up to five or even more years in the most extreme cases. Our all beers last more than 1 year but because the properties change with time, to better almost always guarantee only that period to enjoy what described on the label.

How do fermentation in the bottle always guarantee that the beer will live yeast to the consumer, which on the one hand clears the beer and the other creates gas in it. Because of this fermentation in the bottle our beers have always deposit. These beers should have deposit, because besides any indication of handmade process demonstrates that there has been fermentation in the bottle.",2013,22Q75i,"Faustino - Microcervejeira, Lda.",False,brewery,http://www.maldita.pt/

"At one of the most difficult times in the history of the City of Bethlehem, the Fegley family entered the brewing and restaurant business. The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years – a dying industrial giant of a bygone day – and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.

Bethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of ‘Steel’ and paid tribute to the region’s working class culture in it’s decor and menu. The Fegley’s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.
2002

Most importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.
2005

With an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who’s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess’s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the “Queen city” – from it’s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world’s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. “The All-American City” as it was known, seemed to be frosted over – and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.
2007

In June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold’s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks – built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley’s Brew Works in earnest.
2008

In 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley’s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley’s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.
2010

One of the nation’s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop’Solutely the Beer of the Year.

Becoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable “green” practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.
2011 to Present

In 2011, Fegley’s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it’s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins “Best Summer Beer” at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader’s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.

With the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it’s capacity, and soon Fegley’s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities.

The relaxed island has attracted families, artists, partiers, weekend beach-goers and outdoor sports lovers for generations, yet it refuses to allow cars, pretention and the frantic pace common to NY-metro area culture.

"In the fabled summer of 2003, Jordan Busch and Sara Sawicki told their friends and families they were going to open a wing joint together. Sara had just finished her fifth season of guiding whitewater rafting trips and Jordan had recently passed the Colorado Bar exam. People scoffed. However, for Sara and Jordan the next logical step was to open up a cool wing joint where people could drink cold beer, eat spicy wings, listen to some good music and kick it with their homies. They wanted to open their wing joint in a town that needed great wings and that suited their outdoorsy lifestyles.
After some research it became clear that Portland was the ideal place. After moving to Oregon in the fall of 2003, Sara and Jordan scoped out the town, worked hard in local restaurants, and developed their menu for their new restaurant. Neither of them had ever managed a restaurant, let alone owned one. They attended small business meetings, talked to accountants, restaurant owners and local wing connoisseurs. People asked them if Portland was ready for a wing joint. Others suggested they should have stuck with their previous occupations. The naysayers fueled Sara and Jordan's passion for opening their restaurant even more.
On the first day of 2005, the first customers walked through the doors of Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings. In the early days, there were just a couple cooks and Sara and Jordan were the only front of house staff. Fast forward to 2011 where Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings has become a Portland institution with three restaurants and close to 100 employees.

As George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an “amateur mountaineering expedition” to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.

Now, we all know dogs don’t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn’t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn’t make this extraordinary journey.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site “This Old House meets the World Wide Web”—letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.

He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.

Brewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a “living, breathing” product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.

We hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety.

"Frederic and Emma Robinson with their son WIlliam and daughter Mary. William, pictured here with his mother, went on to marry Priscilla Needham in 1899 and became Chairman of Frederic Robinson Limited in 1920.
Fast forward to the early decades of the 20th century and Frederic’s grandchildren, sons of William, joined the family business. After Frederic’s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.

With bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William’s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house – The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn. The early 1950’s saw 5th generation Robinsons, Peter, Dennis and David, starting to join the business.

Over the past 6 decades Robinsons has continued to grow. 15th October 1975 saw the first bottling at a newly built packaging centre in Bredbury- ongoing development at UPC (Unicorn Packaging Centre) means all our beers are now transferred from Unicorn Brewery to Bredbury for packaging and distribution once fermentation is complete. Robinsons’ bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.

Our eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace. With over £5 million investment in a new Brew House (including the World’s largest hopnik, which strains hops to maximise aroma and flavour), Training Centre for excellence and Visitors Centre, there is much to look forward to.",1838,OEO8JG,Frederic Robinson Ltd.,False,brewery,http://www.robinsonsbrewery.com/

"Established in 1995, Freedom Brewery is a pioneer of premium craft lager brewing in the UK. Now one of the leading brewery’s in this sector, Freedom’s range of beers have won over 25 International and National awards in the last 4 years alone.

All Freedom Beer is bottom fermented in closed, pressurized vessels. Lager is fermented at a lower temperature than ale and therefore takes longer – between 7 to 14 days, in contrast to 4 to 5 days. During fermentation, the beer naturally carbonates itself as a result of the breakdown of sugars to alcohol.

After the fermentation stage, the ‘young’ beer is transferred to maturation or storage tanks, where it’s stored at -1 ̊C. Freedom Brewery has a minimum maturation period of 4 weeks; this improves both the beer’s flavour profiles and naturally increases its stability, removing the need for chemical intervention. The verb ‘Lagerun’ is German for ‘to store’ – ironic as the majority of mass produced ‘lagers’ are brewed within days, with little or no maturation time at all.

Freedom Brewery sterile triple filters its beers to remove any remaining yeast and protein cells. This is instead of pasteurisation which, whilst being a cheaper process, carries the risk of ruining the beer’s natural flavours. Freedom’s first sterile filtration uses diatomaceous earth in contrast to isinglass, which is a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish. As a result, all Freedom Beers are certified by the Vegan Society.",1995,zgCDhX,Freedom Brewery,False,brewery,http://www.freedombrewery.com/

"In 2007 Gordon Schuck’s recipe design and brewing skills resulted in a gold medal-winning Saison at the National Homebrew Competition. Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.
 
Saisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.
 
Funkwerks’ two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.
 
Funkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado.

"Furthermore bought a building way back in 2005 with the hopes of shoe-stringing together an undersized, Frankenstein-style brewery. The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even “cheap” was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn’t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. 

The scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the “Phase 1” section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won’t likely fix our present model. 

So that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the “hate” column—ant that’s always one that someone else places in the “love” column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.",2005,JuFsla,Furthermore Beer,False,brewery,http://www.furthermorebeer.com/

"We are an independent artisan brewery based in the west of Ireland dedicated to the production of high quality, natural and full flavoured beers. All of our beers are craft brewed by combining the finest ingredients with traditional brewing techniques. The result is a beer that has received numerous awards, including being twice named as Ireland’s Best Beer.

We consider beer to be like any other food: the fresher and less processed the better. Our beers are therefore devoid of any preservatives and are brewed using only malt, hops yeast and water. We are passionate about producing exciting and innovative beers that are bursting with flavour and character. Galway Hooker was the first permanent pale ale to be produced in Ireland and is widely regarded as a leading light in the Irish craft beer sector. It has now firmly established itself as a favourite amongst beer enthusiasts.

"We are a state-of-the art 10 BBL brewery and fast casual restaurant in an old automotive center at the end of Old Town Front Street in Temecula. 
 
The brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. 

Equipment doesn’t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style’s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with “soft” water just wouldn’t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.
 
Our brewing system also wouldn’t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn’t at all designed to deal with craft beer. At Garage Brewing Co, we choose our guest beer that has been handled with the utmost care, and we store our own beer just steps from where it was brewed and fermented. Our 10 BBL serving vessels ensure beer delivery in its freshest form and our draft/tap system is highly engineered to ensure that we can pour our guests a proper pint.

"In the spring of 2010, Larry and Peter Geaghan began exploring the idea of expanding operations at Geaghan's Pub to include a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Maine.  Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about “off the clock” to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.",2011,jmyqSv,Geaghan Brothers Brewing,False,brewery,http://www.geaghanspub.com
"Geaux started in a garage…like most startups—in the summer of 2011. Except, it wasn't a garage in someone's house but rather in Jeremy's business. With concrete floors and roll up doors, it was the perfect place to brew beer—and no spouses would be ticked that their kitchen or home was getting trashed in the process. The reason for wanting to ""home"" brew? Because the Friday beer parties at his business were starting to rack up some serious expenses. After all, we wanted to drink the good stuff and 22oz. bombers ain't cheap. So, Jeremy got the crazy idea (as he often does) to figure out a way to make beer so that we didn't have to spend so much money on other people's beer. 

The problem was…where to start? Jeremy knew he wanted to brew beer but the reality was that with so many home brewers out there—each with their own opinion on how to do things—it was going to be a challenge to corral and sift through the information he needed to get started and actually brew good beer. 

After a few ""test"" batches that yielded sub-standard beer, he got serious and started researching and researching and doing even more research until that first ""golden"" batch came through. Eventually, the challenge went from brewing good beer to brewing good beer consistently. Again, with more research, he figured it out. Then, he got the idea. ""What about other new or rookie home brewers out there? Aren't they facing the same problems I am? Wouldn't they and new home brewers want a convenient location to get it hands-on information about brewing?"" At that moment, Geaux went from a hobby to a serious endeavor to bring professional-level brewing techniques to the home brewing community. Then, the REAL fun began.

Going from a ""home"" brewing operation to a commercial brewery (which is required if you plan to brew anywhere outside of home…even if you don't sell it (oops.)) was a bit more than anyone ever envisioned. After a year of plodding away at paperwork, construction, and using up every ounce of goodwill from family and friends, the Geaux brewery and tap room opened up to the public on October 19th, 2013.",,DaJPkB,Geaux Brewing,False,brewery,http://geauxbrewing.com

It wasn’t a side effect of empty-nest syndrome or a midlife crisis. Janet, who endured her husband’s brewing experiments in her kitchen for years, finally banned Gerald’s brewing operations to the garage where he set up a larger operation and brewed the first of his award winning home brews. Realizing Gerald had a great talent, the couple decided to open a microbrewery in nearby Hays.

That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington.

"Originating from the home of Zac and Cari Caramonta, Gnarly Barley Brewing got its start in a crowded garage, amongst the presence of two fat cats and a halfpipe. After being exposed to great craft beer, Zac began homebrewing, first, as an investigation into the brewing process, then with the objective to create beer equally as exceptional as the beers that had inspired him in the first place. Not long after, their garage took a form similar to a science lab and brewing became an addiction.

Gnarly Barley’s homebrewed beer debuted at the New Orleans on Tap beer festival with the Korova Milk Porter and the Hoppopotamus IPA. Gaining positive feedback through local beer festivals and finding many comrades in the local brewing community, Zac and Cari sought to open a microbrewery, giving Zac a better excuse to indulge in his obsession.

Established in 2011, Gnarly Barley Brewing is located in a 10,500 square foot facility in Hammond, Louisiana and consists of a two-vessel 30bbl Brewhouse, one hot and one cold liquor tank, four fermentation vessels, one bright beer tank and a whole lot of passion for craft beer.",2011,vIikZV,Gnarly Barley Brewing,False,brewery,http://gnarlybeer.com/

"We don’t think there’s another beer like this in the market place,” says Duenwald. “Our beers don’t fit any category.”

“Standard brewing philosophy is if you make a beer with a lot of body, it ends sweet,” says Brown. “And if you make a beer that’s crisp, you can’t get body. I came up with a process that allows me to get a rather large amount of body, equivalent to the body of an IPA, but with the finish of a light beer.”

“We’re bringing beer to the market that ale drinkers will enjoy, because they’re going to be different and flavorful, and we’ll grab some of the mainstream drinkers. Take my son,” Duenwald says. “He’s in his 30s, living in Seattle. He’ll start the night out drinking a Mac & Jack’s or a Mirror Pond. He might even have two of them. But when they’re having one of their all-night fun sessions, they’ll switch to drinking Bud Light.

"Like most real brewers, Good People started out with humble beginnings and no intention of ever starting a business. A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).

We took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It’s pretty fun to have someone you don’t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn’t set out to start a business, the business just found us. 

“Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right” Robert Hunter

We wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. 

Good People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company….to be good people.

"When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he’d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes – John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.

The key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process – while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers’ tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island’s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers – and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.

It turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island’s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone’s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.

Today, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

"The brainchild of owner Diego Ganoza, Gravity Brew Lab is designed to be the answer to the question Miami has been asking for the past several years: ""why can't we have creative, top quality, locally made craft beer; like most other metropolitan cities in the U.S.?""

Originally, the concept was to open a really cool beer bar, bringing beer from around the United States and Belgium and making it available for the local enthusiasts to enjoy. However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: ""let's brew our own!"". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless.

Enter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our ""events"" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.

"Good ideas often start over beer. Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.

So with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. ""We're on to something"", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.

This led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our ""anything goes"" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.

Now, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.

Stop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.",,QJRQhZ,Greenbush Brewing Co,False,brewery,http://www.greenbushbrewing.com/

"The idea began a long time ago over … well … a pretty terrible beer.  You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.

As the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.

In the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. 
The promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.

Today our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.

We’re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.

"Our beers are artisanal and often Belgian-inspired. We aim to create elegant ales that are experimental and unique, balanced with complex flavors and aromas. From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.

Gypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).

Each batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!

"So here’s what you need to know. We are brewers and culinarians.

We want our beer to taste good, but we also want it to taste good with food. We don’t want to blow-out your palate, we want you to explore the hidden flavors and understand the complexities of the taste.

We love beer. We want you to love beer.

We will focus on crafting beers between 4.5% and 7.0% ABV. Our goal is a well-balanced, well-crafted, session beer. We’ll do the hop-thing too, but always with an exciting and culinary-focused angle.

Here’s the other thing. We’re adventurous. San Diego is the brew capital of the world (are we exaggerating here… NO!) There’s lots of great brewers. We found a few of them and held them down, twisted their arm really hard and asked them to brew something new and out there for us. Then, we found a few chefs who thought brewing was good sport. We helped them with the technical stuff and set them loose with the brew equipment.

You’ll see their brew in our taproom…they may have other gigs in the city, and we support their efforts there too. Beer is beer. Drink it here. Drink it there. Drink it anywhere (with apologies to Dr. Seuss).",2013,6ODyQZ,Groundswell Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://groundswellbrew.com/

Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery.

"We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because—like today—we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.  

There was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  

We still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",1986,RzvedX,Harpoon Brewery,False,brewery,http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/

"In 1996 an idea was born to start a brewery in west-central Montana with a name that reflected the region's rich agricultural tradition.  Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of Great Falls.  Harvest Moon's first batches were available in late 1997.  Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce.  The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. 

The brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a ""hands-on"" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality.  They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping.  The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town.

Belt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer.

Another great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon’s ties to the farming community don’t end there…after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter. Delicious by itself and, surprisingly, with barbecued ribs!",1997,FwmqM1,Harvest Moon Brewing,False,brewery,http://www.harvestmoonbrew.com/

"The brewery was founded in 1984 by Ken Brooker on a farm just outside Dollar in Central Scotland. Due to the growing success and demand for Harviestoun Ales, the brewery moved to a new purpose built 60 barrel plant, 5 miles away in Alva, in 2004. Alva was chosen as the location as this allowed us to carry on using the outstanding soft water from the Ochil Hills.

Harviestoun Brewery was later bought by Caledonian Brewery in 2006. However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery. 

Currently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery. We are working hard to increase production, while insuring that we still outputting nothing but quality beer.

"Before it was Rapid City, it was Hay Camp. This historical perspective is maintained at the tavern where commerce is held equal to community. Both being Rapid City natives, Karl Koth and Sam Papendick are the owners and brewers at Hay Camp Brewing Company. After graduating from Stevens High School, Karl moved to Minneapolis to earn a degree in Physics and Sam moved to Fort Collins to earn a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering (interesting how both locations are craft beer meccas). After receiving their bachelors degrees, they were reacquainted when pursuing graduate degrees from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.
One evening at a local Rapid City ale house, they began talking about beer and homebrewing. Sam had a great garage and Karl had nearly 10 years brewing experience, so they began brewing beer in Sam's garage almost weekly. Equipment was accumulated, techniques were shared, and plenty of free beer was available for their friends. Karl was finishing his M.S. in Geological Engineering and Sam was in the middle of his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering when they decided to go legitimate. The LLC was formed in August 2012 and they entered the Student Governors Giant Vision Award contest, where they placed third, winning $2500.
It took nearly a year to find a suitable location, but they finally settled on an unused and beat up garage at the Fairmont Creamery (current location). After six months of renovation, the tavern opened January 1, 2014. The beginning was modest, with a 1.5 bbl brewehouse, a 42 gal Blichman fermenter, and two 1.5 bbl single walled fermenters, but their limited time and production complemented their limited overhead.
Karl received his Masters degree and began working at the US Geological Survey and Sam was still finishing his PhD, so the beer was brewed on the weekends and Friday was the only open night. In August 2014, two additional 3 BBL jacketed fermenters were installed, essentially tripling their production capacity. In January 2015, Hay Camp opened on Thursday nights, where they collaborate with Black Hills Vinyl for live music and bingo.
The patio opened spring 2015, which expanded seating capacity and overall fun. Patrons could play corn hole, country bucket, or just soak up the nice summer sun. In July 2015, they ordered a new 3 BBL brewhouse and expect the delivery late fall.
Long term, Hay Camp Brewing Company will remain true to it's Rapid City roots. The current plan is to move toward a 10 BBL production brewery and begin distributing to local drafts. Growth is iterative, however, so stay tuned for adaptation post perturbation.",,ByMER2,Hay Camp Brewing Co,False,brewery,http://www.haycampbrewing.com/index.html

"A UNIQUELY AMERICAN BREWERY

~ Established 2013 ~

We are a veteran owned and operated microbrewery in Manassas, VA. As veterans and patriots, we find that we owe it to our patrons to only produce the finest beer made with the best ingredients with the same level of attention to detail and passion that we brought to serving our country.

100% American sourced ingredients & Organic base malts

92% Locally sourced or Organic ingredients

1% Of every pint goes to charity

ORGANIC & SUSTAINABLE

It is worth the extra effort to pay a little more, make a little less and put a whole lot of elbow grease into things to make a better product. A better product that not only tastes great, but is also made in a responsible and sustainable way. We use 100% organic 2-Row in all of our beers and each of our beers is comprised of at least 90% organic ingredients. No genetic modification, no pesticides, no BS just great beer.

REUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE

Elbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

We want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you. So the next time you have a pint of Heritage be sure to stop and think about all that is going into the beer in front of you.

Ramstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.

Greg found a special brewer’s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point’s careful and proper brewing methods.

The name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.

"The Hofbräuhaus am Platzl, Munich's famous “hofbrauhaus” was founded in 1589 by the Duke of Bavaria, Wilhelm V. It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls. It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous ""Bavarian Beer Purity Law"" of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process. In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages, and 600,000 barrels of Hofbräuhaus beer.",1589,4rlPFf,Hofbräuhaus,False,brewery,http://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/

"The inner battle of good and evil was never more apparent than when one takes that first cleansing sip of HolyBrew. While your ""good"" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.

History - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as “up-tight” without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.
HolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one’s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the “Liquid Confession”. What better way to cleanse one’s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one’s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.

"Innis & Gunn is a specialist independent brewing company based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.

The business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.

Their Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.

According to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.

"The Iron Horse Brewery that opened its doors in December of 2004 was a bit different than today. It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:

""Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...""

The word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. 
Well, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing.

"Island Orchard Cider began on our farm on Washington Island, just across Death’s Door passage from mainland Door County. Located on a hill overlooking Lake Michigan, the property had a few craggy apple trees remaining in the fields.
During family trips to visit Yannique’s French father in Brittany, we always enjoyed going to Creperie restaurants to eat savory galettes and sweet crepes, accompanied by a bottle of cidre brut. Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D’Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.
As we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island’s climate and rocky limestone soil.

"Most homebrewers, at some point, begin to dream of starting their own brewery.  I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer’s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I’m my own worst critic.  I’m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn’t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.

So, after all this research and planning, what’s the plan?  Start small.

Jack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?

This little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I’ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it’s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.

"Jubilee Craft Beer Company, LLC was founded in 2010 by Nashville native Mark Dunkerley.  A Vanderbilt graduate, Mark spent eight years working in sports marketing and development before jumping into the beer world.  He’s a tall guy.  “Circus freak” tall, according to an old lady at the Phoenix airport.  He loves barbecue.  Actually it’s kind of an issue for him.

Mark got into craft beer on a family trip to Oregon in 2004.  The Oregon Brewers Festival opened his eyes to a whole new world of beer and he’s been hooked ever since.

Shortly after moving back to Nashville in 2009, Mark got involved with the Oasis Center through his high school friend Anderson Williams.  After a couple of beers and some brainstorming on how to get the word out about Oasis, the idea for Jubilee came up.  In March of 2010, the first batch of Jubilee Nut Brown Ale hit the shelves in Middle Tennessee, thanks to the good folks at Bluegrass Brewing Company.  In January of 2013, Jubilee brought production closer to home, partnering with Mayday Brewery in Murfreesboro TN to release Randy’s IPA.

Who’s Randy? Well…”Randy” first appeared at Mark’s mom’s 60th birthday party.  When his own mom didn’t recognize him for 15 minutes (including taking pictures with him), he knew he had a good thing going.

Having spent a few years as a homebrewer and always wanting to work for myself I attended Craft Brewing classes at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, OR and read as many books as I could on brewing. I searched for a long time trying to find a suitable place to open up and could be licensed as a Microbrewery. I finally found the location in 2011 and started the move. Then finally in 2012 went through all the legal red tape of opening Everett’s first Belgian Style brewery.

Due to current regulations in the City of Everett we are not open for retail sales. You can make an appointment if you would like a tour or make arrangements for a delivery.

"Glacier National Park, Flathead Lake, Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, snowcapped peaks, miles of hiking trails, raging whitewater rivers, deep fresh powder: Kalispell Brewing Company is proud to call the Flathead Valley home.  When we aren’t out exploring new trails or skiing fresh powder, we’re proudly brewing handcrafted lagers and ales in Montana’s Glacier country.  And after a full day of adventure who doesn’t want a Montana-made beer?

Kalispell Brewing Company has a 10 barrel brewhouse with an additional third vessel which allows us to do decoction mashes. Decoction mashing is an old process which harkens back to continental Europe that allowed brewers to extract sugars from under-modified malts more effectively.  It is no longer necessary to efficiently extract the sugars but with our malt forward lagers, decoction mashing produces a melanoidin-laden wort, which our yeast turns into in a truly complex and well-balanced Montana-made beer.  Sure, we could try to compensate with specialty grains, but it just wouldn't taste the same. With our lager beers, we’re after superior taste. Decoction mashes may take more time and be more labor intensive but we believe, like all good things, it’s worth the wait.",2014,MYbwf3,Kalispell Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.kalispellbrewing.com/
"Kalnapilis is a Lithuanian brewery, established by Albert Foight in Panev?žys in 1902. A landowner of German origin, Foight named the brewery ""Bergschlösschen"", meaning a small castle on the hill. In 1918, the name was changed to a Lithuanian equivalent of Bergschlösschen, Kalnapilis.

Kalnapilis was taken over by Baltic Beverages Holding (established by Pripps of Sweden and Hartwall of Finland) in 1994. Ownership passed to Royal Unibrew in 2001, which merged the Kalnapilis with Tauras brewery in Vilnius into AB Kalnapilio-Tauro Grup?.

In April 1996, new fermentation and storage equipment enabled significantly different processing, the result being the introduction of three new brands. The brewery has an annual maximum capacity of 600,000 hectolitres.

Kalnapilis won 2 gold awards at the 2004 World Beer Cup, the Olympics of beer competitions; one in the German Style Heller Bock or Maibock category, for 'Kalnapilis 7.3', and one in the Muenchener style Helles category, for 'Kalnapilis Original'.

Kauai Island Brewing Company (KIBC) has its origins in Waimea Brewing Company, which had been located on the historic Waimea Plantations. When the lease was up, owners Bret and Janice Larson, along with their brewmaster Dave Curry and his wife Christina, decided to come together and become co-owners of their newly created Kauai Island Brewing Company, moving locations to Port Allen where they would have more space to brew the delicious beers they were known for. 

After eight months of renovation, Kauai Island Brewing Company has its home in the industrial building complex of Port Allen Center, with an industrial theme to go along with both its surroundings and purpose of crafting quality beers. Its 35-foot high corrugated metal ceilings and walls give it an open and spacious feel. The retro atmosphere with chandelier lights hanging from the ceiling, a catwalk leading to the second story mezzanine over the entrance, and picture perfect views of the sunset over Port Allen bay from the second story window makes it hard to say goodbye to this beautiful place.

"A fine and successful Ontario microbrewery, Kawartha Lakes has been producing tasty beers for almost four years. Beginning in 1996 with their now-famous Raspberry Wheat Ale and Pale Ale as draught-only selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with beer connoisseurs.

The brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to their slate, and offered their ales in oversize 473mL bottles for sale at only at the brewery. This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.

Luckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.

"The beginning The Kiuchi Brewery was established in 1823 by Kiuchi Gihei, the headman of Kounosu village. His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.

Fujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes ""KIKUSAKARI"" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.

1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.

Hitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand ""HITACHINO NEST BEER"" with unique owl character logo.
Over the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.
In 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.

Shochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of ""Shochu Kiuchi"" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.

The wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.

In 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...",,a2GCv8,Kiuchi Brewery,False,brewery,http://www.kodawari.cc/

"Barry Nalebuff, co-founder of Honest Tea and a professor at the Yale School of Management, and Ariel Glazer, a natural foods entrepreneur and former Goldman Sachs analyst, met while trekking the Tiger Leaping Gorge in Southwest China.  According to legend, in order to escape a hunter, a tiger leaped across the vast gorge and made it to safety. Barry and Ariel's encounter was a bit less dramatic. They met at a guesthouse midway through the trek.
 
After completing the second day of the trek, on the long bus ride back to the nearest town, Ariel and Barry found themselves yapping and sharing their culinary endeavors with each other.  And soon realized that they shared the same entrepreneurial values and, of course, the love of making wholesome and delicious food and drink.
 
The idea of making kombucha that is low in calories, delicious, and slightly alcoholic had been brewing in Barry's mind for a while.  John Hillgen, one of Barry's students at Yale School of Management, a doctor and a co-owner of several wine stores, fell in love with this concept and suggested that they start a business together.

"The Brewer, Mark Mericle:
Mark's legacy is quite simple. While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, “American beers are boring and just are not very satisfying”. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.

Working as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County’s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage’s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo’s, BJ’s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.

Mark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time.

"In a time in Northern France where trucks and commercial transportation were not yet a part of daily life, the process of brewing beer was a very different one than it is today. In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and cafés with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.

Twenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family – thus the name The 3 Brewers – “three” for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare à Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.

"Levante started as many home brewing dreams start; the mission to create the perfect beer in a three gallon pot in the kitchen of a small apartment. Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.

The brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.

We are excited to open in this historic building, which is over a century old. Built in 1885, the first floor originally hosted a Frye Dry Goods store and blacksmith shop. Legend has it the second floor saw the first meetings of the local Masons. The Steinway piano prominently displayed in the pub was originally brought into the building in 1899. It has never left the building, and is the same piano that was used during the early 20th century to accompany silent films. During our extensive renovations of the building, we elected to preserve the original walls of the first floor, to honor the history of this building and the Frye Brothers themselves, the original builders.

 
We are grateful for the opportunity to establish our business in historic Wardensville and proud to become a part of the local community.
 
We hope that our artisan craft ales and delicious old-fashioned foods will add a little something special to the unique flavor of the beautiful Potomac Highlands.",,SuE1Td,Lost River Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://lostriverbrewing.com/

"Lost Tribes Beverage was founded in 2009 with a passion for innovative and dedicated brewing. We look beyond contemporary trends and call upon the wisdom of ancient brewing cultures. We resurrect lost recipes with precision and expertise, using the same ingredients as our forgotten ancestors. We honor the Lost Tribes by reviving their culture and flavor.

For almost 8000 years mankind has been creating alcoholic brews to raise a glass to a higher power or enliven the power within. Exacting craftsmen would develop brewing into an art form, becoming professionals revered by the community and receiving divine privilege from popular spiritual deities. While the social stature of the brew master endures, many recipes and techniques have unfortunately been lost to history; and it was from the discovery of such a lost brew that Lost Tribes was born.

On our travels through the ancient lands of Western Asia, we met a small community that had walked from Ethiopia to Israel, bringing with them long-forgotten wisdom and tradition. Along with this they had brought the recipe of a forgotten brew called Tej - the fabled gift to King Solomon from the Queen of Sheba. Under instruction in her family kitchen, an elderly woman taught us the process of its brewing, sharing the long-preserved and refined heritage to exact the brew to perfection.

Alongside the Lost Tribes range of inspired traditional beers sits the signature series. Comprised of resurrected brews that were previously lost to time, the signature series embodies the values and flavors of historyʼs brewing pioneers. In this way we honor the lost tribes that have not had the chance to tell their story, and those who inspire us when they share theirs. Assemble your tribe, raise a glass, and tell your story.",2009,HdVJp2,Lost Tribes Beverage,False,brewery,http://losttribesbrew.com/

"In July 2010, over a craft beer at a local restaurant, Eric Biermann and Jon Messier had a Lucid thought – “Let’s throw away the ties and the corporate ladders.  Let’s start a craft beer brewery!”  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.

In June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  

With that leap of faith – and a ton of support from many friends and family – they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer – AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite “go to” beer.  

By October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving… in Jon’s car.  Lucid was on its way!

Always keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover’s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers’ demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  

Great success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.",2011,0cACKo,Lucid Brewing,False,brewery,http://www.lucidbrewing.com/

"Living in Mississippi, the selection of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country – but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the world’s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.

Driven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.

Lucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion – to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer.

"Mark and Paul, cofounders of LynLake Brewery, met early in their careers while building the Norwest Center (now known as the Wells Fargo Center). The two worked closely together while this landmark Minneapolis high-rise was being constructed in the early 1980’s.

As they continued to collaborate on the construction of other high-rises in the Twin Cities, their friendship grew. Fast-forward a couple decades. The two of them were sitting around one night enjoying a few Surlys and had an idea to build something of their own. Not another high-rise. A brewery.

Instead of chalking up their dream to idle beer talk, they stubbornly persisted.

They quickly found a building with its own unique character that would be perfect for their brewery. They soon added Joel, their head brewer, to the team, who shared their passion for craft beer and had connections to both Mark and Paul (Mark and Joel grew up in Virginia, MN; Paul and Joel studied Construction Management at North Dakota State University). From that point on it was full steam ahead with a pilot brewing system, designing and constructing the space, licensing, branding the idea, and most importantly, crafting, sampling and building their roster of unique, well-crafted beers. 

Located in the historic Lyndale Theater in the LynLake neighborhood of Minneapolis, the brewery features a lineup of high-quality flagship craft beers along with seasonal rotations, specialties and the occasional one-off. Each is constructed to bring out the bold flavors and aromas of the high-quality ingredients and served up in a taproom with nearly 100 years of local history.

"There is an old saying that ‘it takes a lot of beer to make great wines…’  Well, we can attest to it!  After nearly 25 years of home brewing to quench our thirst we decided to go-pro. The stack of recipes are too many to count. These recipes and their styling are often layered with a culinary perspective along with visions of a cold frothy beer at the end of a long day making wine. In 2012 we began to turn this passion into a reality.  We reached out to the community around us, the barrel suppliers, equipment manufacturers and our local farmers to literally test the waters.  We pulled barrels and equipment from our wineries and began building a custom brewing system (2 beer barrel system).  In 2014 we found a small space in St Helena, received a use permit and began creating our beers in July of this year…Wow! How did that happen?

"Situated in Southwestern Montana’s Gallatin Valley, Belgrade (home to Madison River Brewing Company) is an outdoorsman’s paradise.  Within an hour, one can be skiing or biking in the Bridger Mountains or Big Sky area, enjoying a hike in one of seven mountain ranges, or fishing world-class rivers.  The latter is where our name originated. 

The Madison River has earned the reputation as one of the best places to fly-fish in the world.  Because the river is located in our backyard, current Brewmaster/President, Howard McMurry chose Madison River for the name of our world-class brewery.  Sticking with the theme, most MRBC beers carry the name of a fishing fly.

Madison River Brewing Company, Inc. started in 2004 when Howard purchased the brewery and equipment from Moab Brewing.  At that time, we contract-brewed for Moab, Park City, and Big Hole breweries. In 2005, Madison River Brewing Company emerged when we received a state license to brew our own brands.",2004,f4HWSu,Madison River Brewing Co,False,brewery,http://www.madisonriverbrewing.com/
"MadTree Brewing Company was started by three self-proclaimed “maniac” homebrewers and aspiring entrepreneurs who believe strongly in the creation of beers that stand up to the best craft brews across the country.
Along with that vision they put their own “mad twists” on their creations. The MadTree approach is simple – create high quality beer, educate the consumer, run a responsible business, and support the local communities.
MadTree engages local artists and craftspeople for their marketing materials, can designs, tap handles and furniture. Many of these efforts have received local and national recognition.

HIGHLIGHTS
- The trio quit their corporate jobs in 2012/2013 and in January 2013 they brewed their first commercial batch.
- In April they opened their taproom and became the first modern craft brewery to can their beer in the state of Ohio.
- Draft Magazine rated PsycHOPathy IPA a 97/100, the second best score for an IPA reviewed by Draft Magazine.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.

 
Soon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the ‘Port Melbourne Brewing Co’ operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.
 
In 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family – an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.
 
In 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury’s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant – so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.
 
Throughout the years we’ve produced some of Australia’s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer – Scott Vincent – leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.",1984,3cTR4d,Matilda Bay Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.matildabay.com.au/

"Born of a desire to see more beer produced by independent brewers in Ireland, Metalman Brewing is the brain-child of a couple of beer enthusiasts who were frustrated by the lack of availability and choice of flavoursome, authentically Irish beer. Inspired by some of the other small Irish brewers, they eventually decided to try and help do something about it.

Business plans were written, torn up, and written again. Locations were scouted, breweries were visited, and - of course - various different beers were sampled to ensure they were researching the correct product portfolio. Dirty job, but someone’s gotta do it.

Gráinne called time on her I.T. career in Jan 2011 to focus full-time on establishing the brewery, while Tim did the honourable thing and stayed put at the day-job to pay the bills. They started brewing their beer at a brewery in Templemore (White Gypsy) while planning the construction of their own brewery in Waterford. Their first beer, Metalman Pale Ale, went on sale in the first week of March 2011, and has been very well received. The brewery took somewhat longer than expected to get up and running, but production eventually moved to Waterford in May 2012.

The name of the brewery is inspired by a navigational aid on the Waterford coast. The figure of the Metal Man was erected in 1823 after a military transport ship called the Sea Horse was wrecked off the Tramore coast, resulting in a significant loss of life. The Metal Man stands on one of three pillars overlooking the bay, his purpose to guide seafarers, and keep them on their true course.

"Located in the heart of the Black Hills, and owned and operated by the same family behind the award-winning Prairie Berry Winery, Miner Brewing Company produces craft beers that are both traditional in nature, and yet truly “South Dakota”.

With five generations of family lineage handcrafting beverages in South Dakota, and with 15 years as winemaker and owner of Prairie Berry Winery, Brewmaster Sandi Vojta is inspired by the traditional brewing styles of her family’s European heritage. By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.

All of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.

We invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013. Stop on by for a flight or a glass, hang out to enjoy our seasonal selections, and stay a while for a little South Dakota hospitality.

So if somehow someone from 1950 travelled in time to go to the pub and had a Moa today they wouldn’t be surprised by its full bodied taste.

"Moccasin Bend Brewing Company is located in the historic St. Elmo district of Chattanooga, TN.  We’re at the foot of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River. 

MBBC was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery’s first beer dinner in October of 2006.

The brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. 

MBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.

And yet there are some physical things that can create magic. A bottle of wine with the one you love, a picnic in the rose garden with a baguette and olive oil, a sparklingly joyous cider to make a memorable night with friends unforgettable. Luxury is not born from spending a lot of money on stuff society expects you to buy. It is not comfort. It is not status. It is the scene of Meryl Streep getting her hair washed in the middle of the African savannah. That magic is the purpose. Everything that I offer has given me a glimpse into the incredible beauty and complexity of our world. That is what I hope to share with you.

"As Natives of West Virginia, it has long been our dream to bring quality hand-crafted beer back to our state.

Originally from Elkins and Helvetia, we were raised on easy drinking beers and homemade wine. Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.

Since then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.

That's our story so far. Thank you for all the great support we've received pursuing our dream.

Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. 

Bart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business.

"Once upon a time, there were two dudes named Donald and Don. One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.

Don and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.

Every patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.

Two years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.

Two and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.

"Since its inception in 1991, the Nelson Brewing Company has been dedicated to producing all natural, traditional, full-flavoured ales. In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.

What does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops.

"Our story starts in the kitchen of David Bryan circa 2006.  That's when the first batches of home-brewed beer began appearing and David's wife Lori began to realize that her husband was forming a lifetime passion.  David's passion would continue to grow and evolve.  He learned the tradition of brewing in America.  The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.  
 
An idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.
 
David spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.

"NW Peaks Brewery is a ""nano-brewery"" located in Ballard. As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative ""experiments"". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.",2010,eRdXNO,NW Peaks Brewery,False,brewery,http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/

"The O'so Brewing Company, 1812 Post Road, Plover, is ready to offer local residents a taste of the unusual as they begin to brew their first batch of beer.

The company, founded by Marc Buttera and Bart Peterson, has one goal: brew beer differently. ""I don't think anyone around here offers what I'm looking at ... we want to fill some voids,I don't want to make a regular brown ale, or pale ale. I want to do something that fits in between.""

The dream for Buttera started when he was in college, and a friend turned him on to home brewing, which he has been doing now for about 13 years. Four years ago, his love of home brewing led him to open the Point Brew Supply, 1816 Post Road, Plover, with his wife, Katina.

""It (Point Brew Supply) has opened my eyes to all the different ingredients that I think a lot of brewers don't have exposure to,"" ""I've played with every single strain of yeast and grain and hop in there.

O'so Brewing Co. is planning to have a varied lineup of beers, with interesting names and flavors. They will have a red ale, a West Coast Pale Ale showcasing American hops, as well as a Black Cocker Bock.

""I'm ready to show the world what I've learned, and I'm definitely not going to do things like other people are, but I think I'm on some sort of weird cutting edge.

"The corporation’s history dates back to 1974 when the construction site of the future brewery was sand filled. The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.

Czech experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.

Soon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.

The plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word ‘Obolon’ comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.

Built according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.

After a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark. Today people on five continents associate Obolon with Ukrainian beer #1.",1980,8FRtPM,Obolon Joint Stock Company,False,brewery,http://obolon.ua/

"Craft beer is a passion, an obsession and a journey. This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear… We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.

Our IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped… FRESH!

We like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can’t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.

Mouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.

At Ocelot, we love two things… Beer and Music!

We believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we’ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.

Ocelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.

To better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.

In the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder.

"Back when the world was a much different place, filled with grunge music, loose fitting clothes, and Wayne’s World movies, two shady characters fell in together and started doing various sketch and wonderful things. One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today’s market, but the goofy and “just OK” beers that home brewers in the 90’s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we’ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity’s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.

Chris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys’ improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn’t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.

At Opposition Brewing we love BIG beers. Be they brews with huge hop presence, big malt backbones, or prominent and unique flavor profiles, we prefer brewing and drinking beers that are approachable, but with the character necessary to challenge the mundane.

We offer a consistent selection of quality, small-batch, beers as well as rotating specialties. We brew weekly, guaranteeing some of the freshest beer on tap in the Rogue Valley. And we offer a truly unique, local, artisan experience.

We also hail from the great Pacific Northwest and choose to honor the ingredients produced here as much as possible in our brews. And while we enjoy the technology available to us now, we know that it could all go away tomorrow, so we believe in a brewing process that is distilled as far down as reasonably possible while still achieving consistently excellent results.

"Orchid Island Brewery is a small family owned and operated microbrewery in sunny Vero Beach, Florida. We are currently focusing on perfecting a small number of west coast-style IPA's and wild farmhouse ales. We pay homage to our agricultural roots by using local citrus zest, following the same tradition that Belgian Farmhouse breweries have since the 1600's. Orchid Island and Indian River County was built around the citrus industry. The area is widely recognized as a region that grows the planet's best citrus.
During winter months when citrus is in its peak harvest, cold snaps sweeten the citrus. If it freezes, it spoils however. What makes Orchid Island unique is its proximity to the ocean and the Indian River lagoon. During the worst winter cold fronts, the ocean and river have a warming affect on the island that keeps the fruit above freezing.

"Our Mutual Friend is a brewery and taproom located in the Five Points neighborhood of Denver. For us, brewing beer began as an excuse to gather with our friends and ruminate on life, philosophy, music, food, and of course, beer. Once we got started, we grew more curious about the brewing process, honing our craft and experimenting with different methods and techniques. Along the way a fundamental question to our process was, how can we do more of this ourselves? Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.

At OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state. 

Part of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We’re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale. We believe in the power of neighborly acts and the spirit of neighbors taking care of one another within the local community. We at OMF support and strive for the Denver community to know each other better and enjoy a good pint in the same process.

"The name of the Paulaner brewery refers to the order of friars that resided in Neuhauser Straße in Munich who were part of the order of Saint Francis of Paola. The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebrüder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Bräu. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz.

"Part brewery, part cafe — and part haunted cellar — Phantom Carriage is now open in Carson. And like so many other craft brewery tasting rooms, Phantom Carriage occupies a commercial/industrial building, this one among the confluence of the 405, 110 and 91 freeways, just a few blocks from the home of the Goodyear blimp.

But unlike other brewery tasting rooms with sparse decor and little style, Phantom Carriage drips with atmosphere. 

Conceived by beer industry veteran (and self-proclaimed beer geek) Martin Svab as a Belgian beer cafe, the project grew when Simon Ford — a skilled and decorated homebrewer known on the Los Angeles scene for his downright fantastic sour beers — signed on. The “small-batch beer endeavor” launched, relying on other local breweries (chiefly Monkish Brewing in Torrance) for production capacity and storage space.

After a favorable reception for the first beer -- a wild Belgian ale that found the sweet spot between tart, dry and funky -- the partners redoubled their efforts to find a local space to house the brewery. Carson welcomed the team with open arms, and a comparatively streamlined bureaucracy. 

The 7,000-square-foot location now houses a tasting room, a small pilot-batch brewhouse, a screening room where Svab hopes to both show his beloved classic horror films and conduct beer education classes, a kitchen focused on sandwiches and small plates.

Also, and most importantly, on premises: over 500 oak barrels previously used by wine and spirit producers. It’s the barrels that set Phantom Carriage apart, as the brewery will focus on wild, wood-aged, and sour beers. 

The brewery took its name from a 1921 Swedish horror film, and the house beers are often named after the luminaries of that age of cinema.

On a recent visit during the soft opening, the tasting rooms was comfortably full and three house beers were available (alongside a well-curated guest tap list and a drool-worthy bottle list).

Oude Muis is an aged version of the primogenitor brew, Cushing a potent golden sour ale that balanced a bracing tartness with a twang of funk, and Rathbone is a dark sour ale that added some fruitiness and a pleasant burnt-sugar sweetness. The latter was a particularly fitting match to the deeply hickory smoked brisket served simply on a baguette with au jus. Cold-brewed coffee is available on tap alongside the dozen beer taps, and there’s a small selection of wine and cocktails (Spanish-style charcuterie will also soon join the menu items).

"When asked, “Why we started brewing?” The common response back in 2009 was, “We like arts and crafts”. The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing—it was love at first smell.

PSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During “Brew Nights,” friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.

Pine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.

"Founded in 2010, Piney River Brewing Company is a microbrewery dedicated to making distinctive craft beers that celebrate life in the Ozarks. Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.

Today, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.

Joleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.

The barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a “nanobrewery”, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.

"When first opened in 1957, the Pinnacle Peak was a general store and rest stop for travelers heading to nearby lakes. To boost sales of his small business, the owner decided to serve dinner on the weekends. It was a great success - and the rest is restaurant history. What started as a weekend cookout has grown into the world's largest western steakhouse with seating for 1800 people inside and outside for 2000.

Pinnacle Peak Patio is renowned for its delicious mesquite broiled steaks, casual western atmosphere, and its ""NO NECKTIE POLICY."" This ""no necktie"" tradition was started one night when a Phoenix executive came in for dinner. The original owner, wanting to keep the atmosphere in his restaurant casual, told the executive, ""Either you take that tie off, or I'll cut it off."" The executive did not take heed and was appalled when the owner pulled out a butcher knife and promptly cut off the offending cravat.

Wanting to be recognized as a victim of this absurd policy, the executive demanded that his tie be prominently displayed for all to see. The necktie was stapled to the rafters along with a business card identifying its victim. Pinnacle Peak is very serious about its ""no necktie"" policy and has cut over a million ties from unsuspecting customers.",,Neba3O,Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse & Microbrewery,False,brewery,http://pppatio.com

"Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer. Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.

 The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.

 Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.

First written records are however dated later in the first years of the 18th century. Records mention the year of 1736 as the foundation year. The brewery bloomed in the era when it belonged to the earl kin of Stadions when it was gradually expanded to current shape.

"The historical beginnings of Pivovarna Laško reach back to 1825, when the mead and gingerbread maker Franz Geyer set up a brewery in the former Valvasor Hospital, which still stands today. One hundred and eighty five years have passed since then, with Pivovarna Laško growing from a local brewery to the leading producer of beer and together with other companies in the Group, into the leading producer of mineral and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages and other beverages on the Slovene market.

Beverages production belongs to the more competitive industries, where multinational corporations, commercial companies and demanding users play the most important roles.

Pivovarna Laško and the Laško Group are embarking on a path of development with the following basic business orientation: to produce and sell innovative trendy products, maintain the market position of its own brand names on the domestic market and to attain again and expand positions in foreign markets achieved in the past.  Furthermore, to use the most advanced technology in the development of appropriate production and commercial programs which guarantee the top quality of beer, non-alcoholic beverages and mineral and natural water.

The umbrella brand Laško is represented by the following products: the Laško Zlatorog, the special beers Laško Club, Laško Dark, and Laško Light,  the light beer Export Pils and the sweet beverage Laško Malt with apple and peach flavours. In addition to the above brands Pivovarna Laško also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.

For special occasions Pivovarna Laško brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna Laško entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.  

Despite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna Laško, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.

The Pivovarna Laško Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.",1825,jNvzFs,Pivovarna Laško,False,brewery,http://www.pivo-lasko.si/

"Back in March of 1987 Gina and Vince Marsaglia, a pair of siblings in their 20′s, bought a struggling pizza place in the sleepy coastal town of Solana Beach, just north of San Diego. From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the “Pizza Port” with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own “San Diego” twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach

The parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge décor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn’t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. 

Early on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant’s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. 

Embracing the same “flavor-driven” principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego’s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival “Small Brewpub of the Year”.

Eric and Eddie began their relationship working in the same company in Atlanta, GA. Both shared the passion of home brewing and soon realized that home brewing together on the weekends became something they always looked forward to. Following long discussions about attempting our dreams we decided to share our passion and start Pontoon Brewing Company. The “Pontoon Lifestyle” came to be as the idea of escaping the daily stresses and relaxing on a pontoon boat. For those unaware, a Pontoon boat is commonly known as a slow moving party platform; it can’t go far and can’t go fast so might as well drink.

"Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.

The restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.

In 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",1852,Q4eTmd,Potosi Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.potosibrewery.com/

With the introduction of PBC’s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that’s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.

The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.  

PBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014….thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we’ll just keep on keepin’ on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.

YOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn’t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we’re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We’d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes. Prescott is an amazing community...let’s keep it that way! THANKS A BUNCH!

"After many years of research (and many samples of beer) the decision was made by Janine Rose to build a craft brewery on site at Otway Estate.  Although a winery, Otway Estate has embraced beer and brewing as much as the love of fine wine.

Blessed with the availability of pure Otway rainwater, we brew all of our beers with this 'gift from the gods'.  It is well known that you need good water to make good beer and there's nothing better than water from the lush rainforest.
The brewery was commissioned in February 2007 with the release of the first two beers took place in March 2007.

At Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer, we believe that beer is diverse in its colour, aroma and flavour and is not just limited to ""yellow fizzy stuff"".
We create beers to match an appearance, aroma and flavour profile - not a budget - so we use the best possible ingredients we can find.  Our repetoire of exciting beer recipes continuously grows and we're always keen to try something new.

We also believe that food is an important part of the craft beer experience and we're always trying to pair good food with our great beer.
We hope you enjoy our beer as much as we enjoy brewing it for you.",2007,jKalfW,Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer,False,brewery,http://www.pricklymoses.com.au/

"We are a family owned and run microbrewery. We simply love beer!! Always have, and always will. Our goal is to brew the best beer possible, using only natural ingredients and respecting the traditional art of brewing.
The beginning… Throughout our trips to Europe as a family, we have visited numerous Micros and specialized brewpubs and enjoyed amazing beer. When Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004 we were happy to see that many of the foreign beers we loved so much started being imported to the island!! Finally more quality and tasty beer options would be introduced to Cyprus.
Unfortunately as we soon found out something was terribly wrong…The beer we tasted and loved throughout Europe just didn’t taste the same…
Long sea transportation and storage time in hot conditions stripped a huge amount of the taste and character of the beer we longed to see in Cyprus.
Then we realized that it was up to us to get the job done. The year was 2008, we decided that we would not tolerate living in a beer desert any more. Prime Microbrewery was conceived.
After going to Hell and back we managed to open our brewery and share our passion for quality beer with the rest of our island. It was a long and hard voyage…",2013,vc2k7G,Prime Microbrewery,False,brewery,http://primemicrobrewery.com/

"At the world's largest wheat beer brewery, tradition and progress go hand in hand: our beer is brewed according to traditional recipes, but using state-of-the-art technology. Today, beer connoisseurs in Germany and around the world regard our traditional specialty beers from Erding, Bavaria, as the ultimate in wheat beer enjoyment.

The beginnings of Erdinger Weissbräu date back to 1886, the year in which construction of a wheat beer brewery in Erding was first officially recorded. After several changes in ownership, the General Manager at the time, Franz Brombach, bought the brewery in 1935 and re-named it Erdinger Weissbräu on December 27, 1949.

In 1965, the son of Franz Brombach, Werner Brombach, entered the business. He took over the private brewery in 1975 and still leads his father's successful business today. In addition to a strong emphasis on quality, Werner Brombach focuses above all on a targeted sales and promotion strategy with a clear brand identity, which highlights the values of the old Bavarian beer specialty and its superior quality standards.

Today, Erdinger weissbier stands for wheat beer enjoyment and the Bavarian brewing tradition. The traditional brewery has established itself as the national and international market leader for weissbier. As one of Germany's largest private breweries, Erdinger Weissbräu is among the leaders on the national German beer market.",1886,m9SH4l,Privatbrauerei Erdinger Weissbräu,False,brewery,http://www.erdinger.de

"In 2010, Josh & Beth Stacy and Josh & Trisha Goodridge--longtime
friends--opened Public House Brewing Company in Rolla, MO, the town's first brewpub.  But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....
 
Josh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.
Josh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   
Fast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  

Many weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  

Goodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, ""I'm coming over to your house.""  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  ""Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job."" 

Josh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. 

One week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was
a hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!

"Quaff: To drink heartily and with gusto!

At Quaff ON! Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.
Quaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.
When Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.
Once Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.
Currently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.

"Quest Brewing Company officially started becoming a reality in January 2012.  That is when Don Richardson and Andrew Watts met for the first time; each with thoughts of opening up a microbrewery in Greenville, SC.  Both had put together plans for their company vision and, as luck would have it, those plans mirrored each other!  The two joined forces and Quest Brewing Company was founded.

Once the business was formed, a brewery name was needed.  After weeks of brainstorming, the name ‘Quest’ rose to the top of our list.  We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.

”People in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.  Whether it is to bike the entire Swamp Rabbit Trail or hike Table Rock, there is a very adventurous spirit here.  We wanted to embrace that.” -Quest’s Andrew Watts

Combining over 60 years of brewing experience with some of the big guys, Rick and Barry sought to create deliciously hand crafted ales and lagers that would bear no resemblance to the world of big beer.

In many cases while they are modeled after more traditional styles, they are unique and stand on their own.

"Reading Brewing Company was an American beer brewing establishment founded by Philip Bessinger in 1886 in Reading, Pennsylvania.

Reading produced a Pennsylvania Dutch Lager at a volume of 1,200 barrels a year. The brewery raised its production to approximately 50,000 barrels a year by 1891. Reading suffered from difficulties after Prohibition began in 1920. From 1928 to 1933, the brewery was closed down. The facility itself was almost dismantled, but U.S. Marshals had trouble breaking the padlock on the front door and eventually left the plant intact. After considerable litigation, Reading brewery reopened in 1934. From 1934 to 1951 Reading ran a 'retro' advertising campaign which played on the nostalgia for simpler times.

In 1958, due to flagging sales, Reading re-branded as ""The Friendly Beer for Modern People."" The change proved successful in reversing the slump and Reading made strong sales that lasted into the 1970s.

In 1976, Reading ceased operations due to increasing pressure from larger macro brewers.[1] The label was purchased shortly afterwards by C. Schmidt & Sons. The brand changed hands several times until 1999, when it was again retired. In 2006, the Label was revived by Legacy Brewing, which produced original Reading recipes.

"David Myers, known as 'Chairman of the Mead', founder of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.

Because of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.

In keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.

In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.

Although only a month old at the time, our clever, thoughtful son, Reuben, came up with the idea of giving Adam a homebrewing kit for his birthday.

We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, “Oh great, there’s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month’s time.”  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we’re married, I couldn’t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!

Our brewers, George, Bob, & Eric come from diverse brewing backgrounds which we believe, despite butting heads occasionally, is a great strength to be harnessed. Rather than setting forth a staunch regiment of a certain style of beer, we want Rexx to grow and progress organically. The artist Robert Motherwell once said ""A subject emerges from an interaction between my self, my I, and my medium."" This is the same process we employ in the creation of our beers. Each beer is born out of a free flowing of ideas; a collaborative exchange of concepts between intellectual thesis and recipe. This then leads to lots of pilot brewing which often leads to further discussion of concept until ultimately either the beer style is determined by the concept or vice versa. This process allows for a great amount of freedom and creativity to already be present at the beginning of every new project.",2015,oMc5DI,Rexx Reserve,False,brewery,http://www.rexxreserve.com/

Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where “the first sip calls for the third”.  We’re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.

Rhinegeist means “ghost of the Rhine”, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.

We self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

"Our first cider press was made in 1906, and its making has been passed on to us as an endearing anecdote. At the beginning of the last century Mr Robustiano Riestra cut down a large tree, probably an eucalyptus, which was transported by two Asturian traditional carts to his house in Santa Olaya de Baldornón (Gijón), where he built a beam press. Don Robustiano already marketed under the brand name RIESTRA and he even owned a store in the popular district of El Llano in Gijón in the early years of the last century. Some years later, the company passed into the hands of his daughter Mrs. Etelvina Riestra who moved to the neighbouring municipality of Sariego when she got married to Mr Ricardo Riestra Hortal, where a new stage of the making of our cider began.

Working in those times was hard, laborious and very demanding, as they did not enjoy the technological advances which are available to us today. In 1947 a new cider cellar was built which meant both a major modernization and also a considerable increase of the production and the trading transactions. In 1985 Guzmán Riestra Riestra took over management of the company, who, in turn, passed the baton to his sons Raúl and Ruben Riestra, who are currently continuing the work started by their great grandfather, placing this family saga among the most traditional ones of the cider makers' guild.

2012 marks another step in the trajectory of this brand. The release of our first sparkling cider, Sidra Guzmán Riestra. This is a sparkling cider produced through the methode champenoise, with a second fermentation and aging in the bottle that has been received by critics and the public with great appreciation.",1906,lg6clw,RIESTRA,False,brewery,http://www.sidrariestra.com/en/index.php

"For 22 years, the Rubicon Brewing Company has been a jewel of a capital city culture. It’s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It’s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.

“This pub is part of the community, and I don’t just mean geographically,” said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. “It’s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we’re connected with the people and that they can trust that they’ll feel at home here.”

Brewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he’s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.

“We’ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we’re very happy with things right now,” he said. “There is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I’m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I’ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, ‘Wow, that’s impressive.’”

In some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown’s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry – first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur – Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.",1987,iBzEfC,Rubicon Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/

"Rush River Brewing Company  in River Falls, WI provides locally brewed ales throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota. Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.",2004,wpQqy4,Rush River Brewing,False,brewery,http://www.rushriverbeer.com

Jeff and Erika are regular people with real dreams. Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, “What do you really want to do in life…(when you grow up)?”  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.

Their first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff’s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.

They evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc…) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.

Salish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner.

"The Sand Creek Brewing Company began on a dairy farm in Downing, Wisconsin, about 20 miles northwest of the city of Menomonie. After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.

Using equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.

Their Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.

Hoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.

"Begining of the industrial development in Bosnia and Herzegovina started with the opening of Sarajevo brewery in 1864. Sarajevo brewery was the only European beer company to keep continued production in the periods of two empires: during the Otoman empire and the Austro-hungarian monarchy. By the end of 19th century, production at the Sarajevo brewery reached 22000 hl, prior the First World War production was at 116000 hl and in 1916 – it has climbed to 150000 hl. From 1965 to 1980, Sarajevo brewery has recorded a steady growth that dropped in period from 1980 to 1984.

I took over the Sarajevo brewery leadership in 1984. Steady growth during the following years reached from 299000 hl to 784000 hl in 1991. Agression on Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 did not haltered the production and our natural water wells provided much needed clean water for the Sarajevo population. Latest war created damages to Sarajevo brewery esteemated 20 million dollars.

From 1995 to 2009, Sarajevo brewery strategic focus was to rebuild damages and to modernize company for what we invested over 80 million Euros. Today, Sarajevo brewery uses most modern technology combined with untouched traditional roots of water quality and tehnological processes.

In 1996, we have installed line producing concentrated juices and can filling. Iin 1997, we constructed facilities for filling the non-alchocolic beverages as well as PET packing with capacity for 12000 bottles / h. In 1998, we signed three year contract with Coca-Cola to service their production. From 1998 to 2002 Sarajevo brewery modernized our beer production line to „state of the art“ technology. In 2002, we signed an agreement with PepsiCo producing lines of refreshing and nonalcoholic drinks from Pepsi's program.

Today, Sarajevo brewery production has climbed significantly producing 800000 hl of beer and 1.000 000 hl of nonalcoholic and refreshing beverages per year.

"In the Early 1970's Geoffrey Scharer, a 4th generation publican of Picton visited England for the international Brew Ex-Trade Fair, where he found the inspiration to brew German Style Beers here in Australia.

Against all odds, convinced that he could make high quality, natural beers Scharer set off about perfecting his recipes and methods. In 1981 he received the recognition he deserved in the form of the first (on Premises) brewing License ever awarded in Australia. He then set about setting up the first Pub Brewery.

In 1987, Scharer opened George IV Inn in Picton where we tapped his traditional style perfected brews. This huge step paved the way for many of the fantastic craft beers now brewed and enjoyed throughout Australia today.

In the early 1990’s Scharer operated and lived in the Australian Hotel in The Rocks where his famed ales (Lager and Bock) were the only beers on tap. If one was to ask for a different mainstream beer, they would be told upfront ‘we don’t sell that shit here’ and moved onto the next pub down the road. Geoff was a larrikin and larger than life itself.

As it happened, there was a foot soldier by the name of Joseph Lögler amongst this troops, who was proficient in brewing beer. The short form of Joseph is “Sepp” or “Seppel” for “little Joseph”. Obviously, by making beer the brave soldier Seppel was of much better use to the King of Sweden, because he was going lame due to an old battlefield injury to the leg. The injury was the cause for his nickname “Schlappe-Seppel”.

The beer of the brave soldier was very well received because of its excellence and very soon after the first brew, he had to make more beer.

The Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named ""Schweiger"" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.

Since 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent ""Moated Castle"" in Au i.d. Hallertau.

The noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.

At present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.

Michael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz’s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.

The Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, ""It will also stay like that"". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.

On the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: ""Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served"" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.",1590,HJTHzW,Schlossbrauerei Au-Hallertau,False,brewery,http://www.auer-bier.de/

"Two words: cool & dark. Schmohz Ales and Lagers, like many quality craft beers, are not pasteurized. While this helps them taste fresher and more full-flavored, it also means that extended exposure to warm temperatures may cause them (especially if they are unfiltered) to taste, well, less fresh. So keep 'em cool! As for the dark part, let's just say that sunlight can negatively affect some brews (it makes 'em smell ""skunky"").

"True to nature, true to the craft

It's the motto of ShawneeCraft, a summary of our philosophy, and the ideal to which we aspire. We call it the fidelis philosophy.

We’re true to nature because environmental impact is a consideration in every decision we make. We honor the nature of materials that we work with. No shortcuts, no artifice. We’re true to the craft because we honor traditions of workmanship perfected by centuries of well-trained hands.

The Fidelis Philosophy took root in the fertile soil of Shawnee-On-Delaware, Pennsylvania. Our village, bounded by wooded hills on one side and the Delaware River on the other, enjoys a mild and varied climate, plenty of water and sun, abundant plants and wildlife and friendly, talented people. We are captivated by this nature and its possibilities. And our location- less than 100 miles from both New York City and Philadelphia- makes it only natural for us to broadly share the Fidelis Philosophy.

In a world of mass-production, our products are handmade. In a world of homogeneity, our products represent a defiant individuality. In a world without roots, our products embody a tangible sense of place. We aspire to eat what we grow, to drink what we brew, and to build what we use. And we’d like you to experience a taste of this lifestyle yourself- in the form of ShawneeCraft beer.",2009,vSGcZr,ShawneeCraft Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.shawneecraftbrewingcompany.com/

"With roots dating back to the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, the Skagway Brewing Company first opened its doors in 1897 to serve the thirsty prospectors who had abandoned everything to head North and strike it rich in the gold fields. During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed its doors in 1904. In 1916, the “Alaska Bone Dry Law” was passed effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the Territory of Alaska.

In 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations. With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews, South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals and visitors alike. This bustling business keeps growing, frantically brewing to keep up with the high demand of its brews and quality-dining menu.

"Incorporated in December 2011, the Skull Coast Brewing Company, Inc., is a new entity formed for the express purpose of brewing and distributing handcrafted artisan ales, and whose history has yet to be written. Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a “Contract Brewing” or “Beer Marketing” company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.

After months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.

The Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words ""Skull Coast"" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.",2011,HX4Prz,Skull Coast Ales,False,brewery,http://skullcoastales.com/

John's family's brewing tradition in Canada extends back to 1834 when John H. Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. 

The passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.

Centralcer – Central de Cervejas, E.P. is incorporated in 1977 following the merger of Sociedade Central de Cervejas, S.A.R.L. (incorporated in 1934) with Cergal - Cervejas de Portugal, S.A.R.L. (incorporated in 1972).

The Company’s total share capital is privatised in 1990, and it is the first operation of this kind to be undertaken in Portugal. The Bavaria Group purchases a shareholding in Centralcer - Central de Cervejas, S.A., and becomes one of its main shareholders.

Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada.

Saint Boniface is the name of the patron saint of brewers, the saint also associated with converting Germany to Christianity. St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.

John was inspired by a tradition of brewing on this site, the foundations of which were laid four centuries earlier. Back in the 13th century the Franciscans established an Abbey, with its own well, on the banks of the River Nore in Kilkenny. Whilst brewing and barley cultivation are recorded in Irish Annals from the mists of time, the strong brewing tradition that exists in Kilkenny started with these monks who would have brewed their own light ale for their visitors, using water from St Francis' Well.

"Mariano Meconi was born in the village of Faleria, Italy in 1895. At the age of 13, Mariano emigrated from Italy to Windsor, Ontario, Canada. As a young man, after school Mariano worked at the Studebaker auto factory in order to supplement his preferred vocation of wine making. 
 
In 1921 at age 26, Mariano founded Border City Wine Cellars, quickly changing the name to the Meconi Wine Company. Following the repeal of Prohibition in December of 1933, Mariano moved his flourishing wine making enterprise across the river to Detroit in 1934. 1936 was the year Meconi moved the family to its present location in Paw Paw, in order to be closer to the acclaimed Lake Michigan Shore grape-growing region. With the move came a new name, The Italian Wine Company. 
 
In 1941, during World War II, Meconi strategically countered rising antifascist sentiment in the United States by switching the name of the company once again, from The Italian Wine Company, to St. Julian Winery. 
 
In the last name change of the company, Mariano Meconi humbly paid homage to the patron saint of his native village, Faleria, Italy. All Italian villages have patron saints and San Giuliano, nee St. Julian, stands as the saint that protects the village and the citizens of Faleria. 

With a rich history, St. Julian still produces some on the long-time favorites, including Sholom Kosher Wine and our award-winning Solera Cream Sherry. Over the past 15 years, St. Julian has focused on producing a new line of single varietal wines. The grapes come from the best vineyards in Southwest Michigan, producing top quality wines. In 1999, Braganini Reserve Meritage was “born” establishing a small lot production of dry, single varietal wines. As excitement from the President and Winemaker grew, St. Julian now has over 15 Braganini Reserve wines ranging in many different winemaking styles. 
 
For over 92 years, the Winery now known as St. Julian Wine Co., Inc. has produced award-winning products. From the first shoots of the Michigan spring through the harvest and barrel tasting of late fall, the family tradition that has flourished transforms grapes to wine, fruit to nectar, as passion and science converge bottle after bottle, case after case.",1921,s5IAhv,St. Julian,False,brewery,http://www.stjulian.com/

Becky Starr, Owner, Sales/Tasting Room Manager
Ben Starr, Owner, Wine/Meadmaker

We first discovered mead in CA at the Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.

In February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association’s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our “Starrlight Mulled Apple Cyser” was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.

Ben shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com.

"In 1957 the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Arnold Nordmeyer threatened to cut international beer imports as part of his ""black budget"" and challenged New Zealand's brewers to ""come up with an international-style lager beer"". Lion Nathan produced a beer the following year named Steinecker, named after the company whose equipment the beer was made in. The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.

In 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.",1957,6sHf19,Steinlager,False,brewery,http://www.steinlager.com/
"It was as simple as waking up one morning with a crazy idea – perhaps not initially realizing it would later become an award winning one! Stellenbrau Brewery owner, Deon Engelbrecht struck gold when he made the decision to venture into the world of craft brewing.

During a visit to the KZN, Deon enjoyed a few craft beers with friends. Rising the following morning for a run, he did not expect to be feeling so refreshed, despite having the proverbial ‘few too many’ the night before. It was at that moment that he knew he wanted to brew his own craft beer and that the only place to do that would be Stellenbosch – a town filled with heritage…and thirsty students!

In 2011 the wheels were set in motion. Discussions with technical specialists took place and building of the brewery infrastructure was well underway. Hard at work to brew a quality craft product, Stellenbrau launched their first beer in 2012, the Craven Craft Lager, which was voted top lager at the Global Craft Beer Awards in Berlin in 2014 – a testimony to Deon’s foresight and vision.",2011,LscjzB,Stellenbrau,False,brewery,http://stellenbrau.co.za/

"A name as important to the success of Detroit as Ford or Chrysler, the Stroh family began with humble roots, brewing beer in a family-owned inn during the 18th century in Kirn, Germany. In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany – the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today

After establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.

During Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.

The Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.

In 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light.

Though the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.",1850,uV6ou7,Stroh Brewery Company,False,brewery,http://www.strohbeer.com/

"When the Calwer Eck opened in 1987 it had been Stuttgart's first micro brewery and one among only a few in Germany. Since that day we are brewing the Calwer-Eck-Bräu following our own recipe. It is a bottom-fermented, natural cloudy beer, fresh from the cave. Although it is strongly liable to the German Purity Law dated 1516 it is different to most other beers, since we are not filtering or pasteurizing it but bring it directly from the brewery to your table.

In order to make your stay a most pleasant one, we serve homemade Swabian delicacies with the freshly brewed beer. You can have a look on our traditional micro brewery directly from your seat in the restaurant and you can join a guided tour upon appointment. There are no separate rooms in our pleasant and friendly pub but we´ll be pleased to reserve the requested number of seats for you in one of our most comfortable places of the pub to make your stay with your friends or collegues most enjoyable.

If you come with a larger group of people you have the opportunity to rent the whole restaurant where we will spoil you with our speciality buffets. It will be a pleasure to help you with the combination of your menue and to create the right atmosphere for your stay. Our catering service will bring our home-made delicacies to ever place you want. We will be pleased to handle the whole organisation of your event.

"Sudwerk brews and bottles Swiss Beer in Zürich Oberland.  Unlike others that brew “Pale Ale Style”  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pfäffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don’t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us “The Rothschild of Beer”. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a “Local” or “Swiss Beer”. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated “Kleinbrauerei”/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getränke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Zürich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getränke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!

"When Wilson Barr and Tommy Hester met at Williams College in 2007, both were pitchers on the Varsity baseball team. However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite®.

While in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite – a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers’, which stands for ""Two Williams Pitchers’,"" or ""Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,"" was immediately settled on as the brand name.

After months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite in San Francisco. Armed with their Airstream office, a little bit of know-how, and a whole lot of gumption, Wilson and Tommy are committed to quenching your thirst, one bottle of Snake Bite at a time.

"TailGate Beer was founded by a 21-year-old homebrewer, Wesley Keegan. The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.

Tim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn’t come with startup funds.

They both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country.

"Taybeh Brewery is a Palestinian brewery founded in 1994. The brewery is located in the West Bank village of Taybeh, 35 kilometers north of Jerusalem. It produced its first beer in 1995 and has since developed a global cult following. It has been described as a pioneer microbrewery in the region, being that it predated the first Israeli microbrewery, The Dancing Camel, by about ten years.


Milestones:
By 2005 the company was only able to produce 300 cases a week locally due to conflict with Israel. Taybeh beer sold in Europe is brewed and bottled in Belgium with the license held in Germany.

In 2005, an annual Oktoberfest-style beer festival was launched. Dubbed the Taybeh Beer Festival, it opens in the beginning of October.

In 1997, Taybeh beer became the first Palestinian product to be franchised in Germany, where it was brewed and bottled for sale in Europe. Taybeh beer is also exported directly from Taybeh to Sweden.

In 2008, an Australian named Lara van Raay produced a documentary called Palestine, Beer and Oktoberfest Under Occupation, which focuses on the Taybeh Brewery and the Khoury family.


Products:
There are four varieties of Taybeh Beer: Golden, Light, Amber, and Dark. 

In 2007, a new non-alcoholic beer variety was to be launched specifically for the local Palestinian Muslim market. 

The original brand was Taybeh Beer Golden. The Taybeh Beer Dark and Taybeh Beer Light were introduced for the 2000 celebrations in the Holy Land. The Dark variety follows a classic style of the way monks brewed beer in the Middle Ages in order to fortify themselves during their fasting.",1994,z9H6HJ,Taybeh Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.taybehbeer.net/

In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).

"From this country’s very beginning, brewing was commonplace on farms. From the incomparable Oxford Companion to Beer: “Like many gentlemen farmers of his day, Thomas Jefferson’s estate included a brewery.” Radical Brewing, the highly regarded and entertaining source on the history and craft of beer, includes Jefferson’s recipe for “Plug Nickel”, Jefferson’s version of pale ale, and another for George Washington’s “Small Beer” (a recipe Radical Brewing, by the way, calls “crummy”).
It was only the Industrial Revolution and improvements in the transportation of goods that spelled the demise of hand crafted, small batch beers brewed locally on farms, much as they spelled the demise of many farms themselves. This is all a long way around the barn to suggest that brewing beer was an integral part of agriculture as this country once knew it, as opposed to the agribusiness we see today.
Here, we’ve embarked to follow in the footsteps of the founding farmers. As the on-site brewers, the Brewers of Nye Hill Farm, we strive to source local and American ingredients and, of course, our own farm produce. We brew in single barrel batches in our barn-based brewery that overlooks our orchard, pastures and fields, and we’ve aptly named our flagship series of Pale Ales, “Nye P.A.”",2015,qWCQEQ,The Brewers of Nye Hill Farm,False,brewery,http://www.nyehillbrewers.com/

Cream Steam - Steam Beers are in a category all their own. Is it a lager? Is it an ale? Actually, it’s a lager brewed at ale temperatures. This higher temperature fermentation produces a beer with more “fruity” qualities than your average lager. The hops are 100% Northern Brewer, but Robert has lowered the hop bill to make this Steam Beer a bit more creamy and smooth.

The military members surrounding Wade sent him to his son’s side to aid in his recovery.

In the days following the party Wade received numerous comments with regard to the beer quality along with suggestions he turn commercial. for over a year he dismissed the accolades and continuing pressure he was receiving.  In May of 2013 Wade and Mary Jackson, co-founder,  embarked on their journey to establish the NH based brewery and become the first disabled veteran owned brewery of modern times. Together they completed the market analysis, business planning and secured the first location, which was soon after changed.
Credit for the brewery name goes to Mary. When challenged by Wade to come up with a name that embraced a patriotic theme, his disabled veteran status, and the State of New Hampshire– she delivered.

"The fruit that is used in Tieton Cider Works cider comes from Craig and Sharon Campbell’s Harmony Orchards. This land has been in our family since the 1920’s when our grandfather planted his first trees in Tieton, Washington. We take our stewardship of the land seriously and have been farming organically for the last 25 years.

As a third generation Yakima Valley farmer with a degree in horticulture from Washington State University and over thirty five years’ experience in marketing produce, Craig has always been curious about the back-story: the history, production, science, and industry of food. Growing different varieties of trees is truly what makes Craig happy and he is always looking for new varieties to plant and nurture.  In 2008 he was introduced to cider apple varieties, those gnarly, inedible wild apple varieties needed to make great cider.  He planted twenty five varieties in a test block of two acres to study the growing patterns: did each fit into the existing bloom and harvest schedule of the farm, what were the flavor profiles of the fruit and how did that variety add to the cider that we wanted to make.

From that original twenty five, Craig has narrowed it down to the eight most suitable for commercial production, never closing the door on annual experimentation when he learns of a new variety. We now have the largest acreage of cider apples and Perry pears in the state of Washington with 55 acres.

The Yakima Valley is the largest apple producing region in Washington and there is an infrastructure existing in our valley that provides many advantages when you are making cider.  Whether we are storing our apples in controlled atmosphere, sending our apricots and cherries to be processed, or selecting the complementary hops and pumpkin for our seasonal ciders – it all exists in the valley we call home.

A love of land, food and drink has inspired us to make cider with the fruit we are growing at our ranch, Harmony Orchards.

"Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Company was founded in 2007 with a mission of producing world class beers that could bring awareness and resources to the preservation of the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley’s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.

Our award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.

"In 2005, sat Tobias Emil Jensen and Tore Gynther at a party at their old high school with their teacher Mikkel Borg Bjergsø and spat into a flat sickly lager. The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).

Later created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school. Here they continued to hand brew until in 2010 found that two beers were now ripe to make its first commercial brew.

"Treehorn Cider started with a conversation among friends in Fall 2013. We all love craft beer, good wine and great food – especially from local producers. Hard cider began popping up in the craft beer cases around town. Local hard cider production in North Carolina and across the country was starting to take off. So we asked ourselves – why not Atlanta? Our home city has a vibrant farm-to-table restaurant scene, and more than 60 farmers markets. North Georgia has robust apple production. Craft cocktails, small-scale craft breweries and local restaurants dominate growth in the city. We would jump on the chance to taste a locally made hard cider, so why didn’t we make it ourselves?
So it began. We carefully considered where in Atlanta to base our business, and ended up just where some of our partners grew up – Marietta. We leveraged years of home-based cider making, and started figuring out how to make the best cider – clean, refreshing and pleasantly sweet, while avoiding the cloying taste and heavy back-sweetening found in most national brands.
Treehorn Cider is available in restaurants, bars and growler shops throughout Georgia. We love talking and thinking about cider, and above all making cider that you can drink with any meal, any time.

"We craft beers of balance and celebrate the small, unassuming sources that create large-scale positive change - the trim tab. Boom. 

Whats a trim tab you say? Look no further than the words of a genius published in a 1972 Playboy.....

“Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]— the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, call me Trim Tab.” 
– Buckminster Fuller (Playboy, February 1972)

"Tröegs Brewing Company was established in 1997 by brothers Chris and John Trogner. Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tröegs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). 

In addition to these beers, Tröegs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. 

In late 2013, Tröegs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tröegs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tröegs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. 

The Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tröegs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. 

Tröegs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tröegs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.

Our state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. 

Our Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef’s specials.

"An interest in history and beer led Bob and Ellie Tupper to  a quest throughout the United States and Europe to talk to brewers and sample classic examples of traditional brewing styles.  In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.

By the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made—one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Ale was the result.  

In 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.

The Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.

"In 1985, while attending the University of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh, on “aqueous beer foam” (the head of a beer). It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.

They decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful “Twin Lakes Farm” in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam’s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. 

Today Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed’s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious.

Who Was Uncle Bear, You Ask?

 

    Well he was a fun loving good fella, of the Labrador mix named “Bear”. In the good ole’ days as a young pup, he could be found cruising the college campus at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, body surfin’ at Doggie Beach in Ocean Beach (San Diego), skiing down the snow capped mountains in Ruidoso, New Mexico, relaxing in the Hot Springs of Arkansas and finally making his home in the Valley of the Sun. Since Bear was an active dog and on the go, he wanted to create a place where he and his friends could “Come, Sit And Stay”.

    Well Uncle Bears’ Brewhouse Grill is that place. Born out of Bear’s  love for craft beer and excellent food, we have created an upbeat, fun atmosphere where friends, family and co-workers can come to enjoy a variety of delicious menu selections & NOW our own locally brewed craft beer. The Uncle Bear’s Brewhouse opened in 2013, as well as the 4 Grill and Bar locations were re-branded to the Grill and Tap concept that same year.

On the menu, whenever you see Bear’s paw print  you can be assured the item is a long-term house favorite or a new favorite we are sure Bear would have loved. Try any one of the items from the “Famous” Sliders, Backyard Burgers and Birds, Big Plates and Serious Sizzles, Gourmet Pizza, Bear “Bites” or Wing selections and you are in for a true treat.    

The unique motif has been designed to resemble all of the places Bear or your family dog would hang out such as the garage, backyard or home.

 In addition to the excellent food menu, we feature fantastic house drinks and NOW a wonderful selection of craft beers brewed on site in our state of the art display brewery. Be sure to try a Flight Bone (5-4oz. tasters) or a Growler (64oz. take-home jug) or a pint of our craft beer.

"Wasatch Beers (Schirf Brewing Company) was formed when Greg Schirf found his way to Utah from Milwaukee, America’s beer capital, only to discover that his newly adopted home state did not have a brewery of its own. Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.

In fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah.

A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. 
 
Raised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina.

At Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink.

Inspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA.

"Based in West Bend WI Lithia is committed to brewing quality beer to benefit the community. The Beer That Made Milwaukee Jealous!

In the Lithia Beer spirit and tradition, Lithia is based not only on the finest natural, quality ingredients and processes, but also on extremely pure, hand-crafted, mineral-containing water. West Bend Lithia Beer  is a serious beer drinker’s beer, not a chemically concocted, watered down, commodity beer...it’s simply more beer and less water. Lithia Beer contains no corn or rice grains. 

Only the finest hops, and slow roasted, as well as other malts, are utilized. A true pre-Prohibition brew. Lithia Beer is serious beer for serious beer drinkers.

“A great beer that’s 
great for the community too” ™

Recreating the Lithia Beer line, as with all good brews, will be a work in progress. Our first brew, Regner Red, a great Rich, Crisp & Creamy Style Red Ale, a very smooth, drinkable brew, was developed in the great spirit of Lithia beer of the past before prohibition. Popular tastes in beer have changed and matured, as have the brewing process and ingredients. We have chosen to develop extremely high quality, natural beers that will be popular with the sophisticated customers of our time and in our community. We utilized the same process to roll out other Lithia Premium Beers such as Bucky Blonde Ale, arguably the most complex, richest blonde beer ever brewed.

Most importantly, Lithia Beer will again, and exclusively, be based in West Bend & Washington County, where it belongs. It’s heritage will now continue to benefit our community for hopefully, the next hundred years. A portion of Lithia Beer proceeds are donated to The Museum of Wisconsin Art, The Washington County Historical & Humane
Society’s, and rebuilding Regner Park plus many other area charities.",1848,nkvfdC,West Bend Lithia Beer Company,False,brewery,http://www.lithiabeer.com/

We use fruit from our own orchard of traditional and untraditional cider varieties as well as apples grown by other New England orchards. Commercial yeast is added; occasionally we use the wild yeast on the apples. West County Ciders stand out by the simplicity of our ingredients: whole apples, a little yeast, and a bit of sulfite (found in nearly all wines).

"Wildcard Brewing Company was just a dream until experience, encouragement and circumstance made it a reality. The idea behind the name Wildcard is to pursue the unknown. Wildcard Brewing Company’s owners left stability for chaos, moved to England to learn the craft of beer making, and started a business in an uncertain economy, all in pursuit of a dream. You’d call them crazy, adventurous, unpredictable....a wildcard. Our story is one of the unexpected; a place where there are no limits, where perseverance and a free spirit will turn dreams into reality. 

It started when Jeff and Jenny brewed two beers to give away as wedding favors at a brewery in San Luis Obispo where they went to college. Homebrew projects and burst bottle explosions ensued in the years after. But a casual passion soon turned career as Jeff and Jenny headed to England. Jeff studied brewing science at the University of Sunderland and Jenny conducted “research” in various local pubs. Once back in the states Jeff headed straight for the most competitive brewing location, the Pacific Northwest. Now 4 years later the pair are back in Jeff’s hometown of Redding building out their production brewery.

Wildcard is small startup business focused on brewing flavorful beers and enriching the communities that enjoy them. Spending dollars locally is just a part of that commitment. We will source products and services within 500 miles of our facility as much as possible and intend to exclusively sell beers within that same area. Supporting local businesses not only has great economic impacts but environmental as well. We don’t want to just do business in the Redding community we want to be a part of it.

Over the years, as more acres were acquired, paddocks and stables were added and, in 1988, the vineyard was founded. This 55-acre vineyard is part of a 175-acre estate with boarding stables, 30 paddocks, an indoor jumping ring, and a Grand Prix field.

Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter’s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.

 Having already established Margaret’s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter’s passion – brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He’s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country’s most popular brewing supply shops.

Worth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret’s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition – the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation’s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing – perhaps one of the world’s smallest craft brewers – brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.",2007,5hWjSw,Worth Brewing Company,False,brewery,http://www.worthbrewing.com/

Thanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.

At Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.

"Dear visitor,
Zatec is an area which has become famous for its hops. The first hops were grown in 1004 and the brewing followed shortly. The combination of the dark red soil, rich in ferrous oxide (which retains water) and climate allows the region to produce the award winning crop.
The Zatec brewery - built in 1801 - is situated inside the Zatec castle walls, overlooking the town and hop fields.
The brewery suffered for lack of investment during the Communist years until by 2000 the brew was hardly available even locally, much to the detriment of the Zatec economy. In year 2001 Rolf Munding purchased the brewery from a local business man and began a program of investment which has rejuvenated the brewery and improved the prospects for the beer, brewery and the people of Zatec, both as beer drinkers and brewers.

"About Zeunerts Craft Beer

BAVARIAN BEER CULTURE AND NORTHERN SWEDISH CHARACTERISTICS

This is precisely what Zeunerts is. A combination that guarantees high quality. It is quality that is the basis of Zeunerts’ business. The Bavarian art of brewing is without a doubt the finest in the world. As early as 1859, Christoffer August Zeunert introduced copper vats and open fermenting tubs in production and the tradition of ageing the beer to the perfect maturity and flavour. It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws.

 ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE

We are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer. At least that was the opinion of Christoffer August Zeunert. Hops are the spice of beer. The little hop cones contain the hundreds of flavours that give beer its bitterness, flavour and aroma. All hop varieties are carefully selected to suit their particular type of brew.",,K6tR8d,Zeunerts,False,brewery,http://zeunerts.se/

"Der Heurigenwirt Zum Martin Sepp ist mitten in Grinzing. Er steht gegenüber der Pfarrkirche, wo einst schon die Römer siedelten. Denn Grinzing hat Tradition: ein Vorort zu Wien, eine Landpartie für das Bürgertum, ein bewahrtes Dorf in der Großstadt. In seiner bewegten Geschichte konnte Grinzing stets das Wahrhaftige erhalten und das Neue behutsam integrieren. So blieben die einzigartige Landschaft, der hervorragende Wein und die Liebe zum guten Essen. 

Wir finden das gut.

Im Zeichen dieser Philosophie bieten wir unseren Gästen – ob privat oder Firmen – heute eine wahrhaft große Bandbreite. Etwa an Kulinarischem: von Alt Wiener Heurigen-Klassikern bis zu saisonalen Spezialitäten und unsere Weine vom eigenen Winzerbetrieb Martinshof. Oder an Ideen für Feiern: von Heurigenmusik bis zur Anfahrt mit einer Oldtimer-Tramway, von der privaten Weinverkostung mit Freya und Michael Martin, den Winzern des Martinshofs, bis zu Festen im Freien oder im wunderschönen Kellergewölbe. Apropos: Wir sind ein bisschen stolz auf unsere vielfältigen Räumlichkeiten. Denn manchmal braucht man eine lauschige Nische für zwei. An anderen Abenden einen ruhigen Tisch für ein paar Geschäftspartner. Mal feiert man Omas Geburtstag zu dreißigst, einmal das Fest seines Lebens mit 400 Freunden. Ist uns alles recht. Der Martin Sepp stellt sich auf seine Gäste ein, gediegen für einen formellen Rahmen, gemütlich fürs Verweilen. 

Wir freuen uns auf Sie.",,4Mk99f,Zum Martin Sepp,False,brewery,http://www.zummartinsepp.at/

"The brewery started brewing in 1856. It remained in the hands of the Habsburgs until nationalisation in the post-WWII communist Poland. At the beginning of 1990s a court case was started by the descendants of the original owners, who sued the Polish government demanding $77 million compensation for the nationalisation and the use of the Habsburg family name and coat of arms for marketing purposes. The case was settled out of court on undisclosed terms in December 2005.",1856,yIJx1Z,Żywiec Brewery,False,brewery,http://www.zywiec.com.pl/

"ÆppelTreow Winery & Distillery is a producer of small batch cider, perry and spirits.

Cider and Perry?  We use the pre-Prohibition meaning of ‘cider’, so we’re talking about fermented or ‘hard’ cider. Perry is the pear analogue to cider.  We use lots of different kinds of apples and pears in our products.  Some modern.  Some heirloom – no longer grown for stores. We make a range of styles: sparkling, draft, still/table, and fortified/dessert.  Within a style, we lean to the dry end – but also have some medium-sweet offerings.

We are also a distillery.  We use Wisconsin grown crops and wood to make whiskey and brandies.  Distilled spirits may be powerful, but they are also flexible.  They are nice neat (straight up), and even more fun in cocktails.  We encourage people to mix our products up and add their own creative touch.",,FbJSGN,ÆppelTreow Winery & Distillery,False,brewery,http://aeppeltreow.com/

"""The Fifth Ocean"" - the undisputed leader in sales of live draft beer. Alive only natural we call beer unfiltered, unclarified, unpasteurized, no preservatives and no artificial color. Water, malt, hops and brewer's yeast.

Freshly brewed beer contains yeast cultures that create a rich taste and aroma, valuable for true beer connoisseurs.

Lively environment does not allow for pouring beer stored for a long time. Only the ""fifth ocean"" does not extend the life of beer processing which spoils the taste. So beer ""Fifth Ocean"" goes to the store in industrial equipment - mobile tanks secondary fermentation and bottled on site.

Bottled live beer can be stored for more than 3 days. Thanks to a truly magnificent natural taste and high quality - live beer ""Fifth Ocean"" has been recognized connoisseurs in Russia, Kazakhstan, Vietnam and China and many other places.",,kbYLdj,Пятый океан,False,brewery,http://www.fifth-ocean.ru/
