It has been described as a “truly great example of a bottle-conditioned ale” by beer writer Jeff Evans and Oz Clarke describe the flavour of Special London Ale, ""...like making love in a hop garden. ""

It is a 100% malt brew combining Maris Otter and Crystal malt with Fuggle and Golding hops. Golding and Target hops are added after fermentation, which creates an exciting fresh and hoppy bouquet. Fresh yeast and wort are added at bottling to continue the maturation as a ‘live’, bottle-conditioned ale. ",1,['Strong Ale - English'],3.554

Concerning the taste, the Ale has a gentle taste with a slightly bitter finish. Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor was launched in 2008 on the Zythos Beer Festival and hit the mark: the visitors elected it as best beer, bringing Het Anker “The Consumer’s trophy Zythos Beer Festival 2008”.

exist on this planet, which is why we feel that here on earth it would be better described
as a Belgo-American Style Imperial Table Wit. It is a low abv wit beer hopped to IPA
standards with Orbit and Sorachi Ace hops. Throw healthy doses of orange peel, lemon
peel, and a smidgeon of coriander in the whirlpool and you can expect zesty lemons
with restrained Belgian esters of bubblegum on the nose. These descriptors ring true to
the flavor of the beer as well, and a large portion of red wheat in the grain bill imparts
significant body with nourishing qualities to this sessionable crusher. Finishing balanced

Brand Premium Pilsener onderscheidt zich door zijn krachtige smaak. Bij Brand brouwen we ons pilsener namelijk met méér hop en dat zorgt voor méér smaak. Het volledig volmout gebrouwen pils van Brand kenmerkt zich door de perfecte balans tussen haar hopbitterheid en hoparoma. Dit komt doordat Brand twee keer in haar brouwproces hop toevoegt aan het bier. Aan het begin, voor de kenmerkende hopbitterheid, en aan het eind van het brouwproces voor het kenmerkende bitteraroma van het bier.

SMAAK
Het beste proef je de bitterheid in de gehele mond. Voor onze bieren gebruiken we Saazerhop uit Tsjechië, een hop met een zeer delicaat aroma en op hopgebied het neusje van de zalm.

BRAND 'FLUITJE'
In Limburg genieten liefhebbers van Brand uit het zogenaamde ''Fluitje''. Het glas, waarin ongeveer 20 cl bier gaat is afkomstig uit Liburg en wordt in de volksmond ook wel ''Piepke'' of ''Pijpje'' genoemd. Het 'Fluitje' is vernoemd naar het champagneglas 'Flute'. Het heeft dezelfde vorm, maar dan zonder voetstuk.

PILSGLAS
Het nieuwe pilsglas van Brand zorgt ervoor dat de typische hopgeur én smaak dat zo kenmerkend is voor Brand, perfect tot z’n recht komt.

Het dunne glas zorgt voor de ultieme smaaksensatie, omdat je het bier bij kanteling van het glas diréct proeft! de mooie schuimkraag waardoor je meteen de unieke hopsmaak van Brand proeft en ruikt.

It is unequivocally certain that your feeble palate is grossly inadequate and thus undeserving of this liquid glory...and those around you would have little desire to listen to your resultant whimpering. Instead, you slackjawed gaping gobemouche, slink away to that pedestrian product that lures agog the great unwashed with the shiny happy imagery of its silly broadcast propaganda. You know, the one that offers no challenge, yet works very, very hard to imbue the foolhardy with the absurd notion that they are exercising ‘independent’ thought, or attempts to convey the perception it is in some way ‘authentic’ or ‘original.’ It’s that one that makes you feel safe and delectates you into basking in the warm, fuzzy, and befuddled glow of your own nescience. Why so many allow themselves to be led by the nose lacks plausible explanation. Perhaps you have been so lulled by the siren song of ignorance that you don’t even notice your white-knuckle grip on it. You feel bold and unique, but alas are nothing but sheep, willingly being herded to and fro. If you think you are being piqued in this text, it is nothing when compared to the insults we are all asked to swallow streaming forth from our televisions and computers. Truth be told, you are being coddled into believing you are special or unique by ethically challenged “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain” marketers who layer (upon layer) imagined attributes specifically engineered to lead you by the nose. Should you decide to abdicate your ability to make decisions for yourself, then you are perhaps deserving of the pabulum they serve. Double Bastard Ale calls out the garrulous caitiffs who perpetrate the aforementioned atrocities and demands retribution for their outrageously conniving, intentionally misleading, blatantly masturbatory and fallacious ad campaigns.

HISTORY

The Turkey was named the official bird of the Rogue Nation in August 2007. To commemorate the momentous occasion, Rogue Juniper Pale Ale was dedicated to “the turkey in each of us.” An axe and the dedication have been added to the serigraphed 22oz bottle and Juniper Pale Ale tap stickers.

The Pilgrims were ale drinkers and most likely enjoyed beer at the first Thanksgiving. Juniper Pale Ale, like all Rogue products preserves water by using more ingredients, contains no chemicals, additives or preservatives and uses Free Range Coastal Water.

The beers were loaded on to a 60ft, former round-the-world Clipper and left Greenwich, London on May 15th and then headed across the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, stopping at Denmark, Sweden and Finland before arriving in Saint Petersburg on June 18th.
 
When the beers arrived they were tasted by a panel of judges who selected the winning stout.

We’re not stupid enough to completely take on 100?s of years of German brewing tradition and regional knowledge so we’ve made a few changes to the method we will use in the production of the beer, all of which should give us the best chance of making the beer representative of the style.

Tot februari 1986 was het bier op fust alleen in de herfst verkrijgbaar, toen vanuit Maastricht een protestdemonstratie werd georganiseerd om Brand Imperator het hele jaar te kunnen tappen. Onder het motto 'maak geine flater, oet de kraon d'r Imperator' werd luidkeels geprotesteerd voor en in de brouwerij in Wijlre. De directie ontving de klagers in 't Kelderke en onder het genot van een glas Brand Imperator kwam men overeen om het bier ook op fust het hele jaar door te leveren.

This beer is brewed exclusively from spring water, barley malt, hop cones, candy sugar, and yeast. The aroma and the fine taste are due more to the hop cones and the yeast than to the malt that is used.

What’s special about Orval’s beer is that hops are added at two different stages of the production process.  First, in the brewing room, a large quantity of very fine hops are added – this produces the famous bitter taste and is the reason why the beer keeps for a longer period of time.  Later, in the storage cellars, hops are once again added.  This is the so-called British “dry hopping,” which produces the delightful aroma that completely enraptures even the most carefully forewarned taster.

In the tasting room, Orval’s beer and cheese make a really good pair:  the unique shape of the bottle and the glass, the design of the label, the coasters and other publicity materials – it’s all a legacy from the early 1930’s.",2,['Pale Ale - Belgian'],3.791

In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer. Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this. The name pays tribute to the unique ecclesiastical status of Masham as a ‘Court of the Peculier’ and is also reference to the strong characteristic of the beer! For many years it was affectionately referred to as Yorkshire’s ‘Lunatic’s Broth’.
Old Peculier is a beautiful, yet very simple beer, brewed using a very generous blend of finest pale, crystal and roasted barley with two bitter hops combined with the majestic and noble ‘Fuggle’ hop to produce a beer of awesome full-bodied flavour with subtle cherry and rich fruit overtones.

De bieren van Texels worden gebrouwen van uitsluitend natuurlijke grondstoffen zoals zuiver duinwater, Texelse gerst, hop en gist van de eigen Texels giststam. Ze zijn daarom erkend als ‘Echt Texels product’.

Texels Tripel is een vol en krachtig speciaalbier met een klein zoetje en een kenmerkende hopbitterheid in de afdronk.

Texels Tripel wordt gebrouwen volgens tradities die al stammen uit de Middeleeuwen. Door de grotere hoeveelheid gerst die nodig is om een ‘Tripel’ te brouwen, was het toen een bier dat alleen de adel zich kon veroorloven. De minder gegoede burgerij dronk ‘Dubbel’ en voor de laagste klasse was er ‘Enkel’. Een bier dat nu niet meer gebrouwen wordt.

In de Gouden Eeuw kenden de Nederlanden een periode van grote welvaart. De schepen van de VOC lagen voor de Rede van Texel te wachten op gunstige wind om uit varen naar de Oost. De handel vierde hoogtij en de luxe van Tripel was voor een groter publiek weggelegd.

Apart from pure spring water, which is the main ingredient of beer, barley is the most important raw material. Barley must germinate for five days in the malt house, after which malt remains. The colour of the malt and as a consequence also of the beer is determined by the temperature. Duvel obtains its typical bitterness by adding various varieties of aromatic Slovenian and Czech hops. We use only exclusive hops that are renowned for their constant, outstanding quality.

Duvel ferments for the first time in tanks at 20 to 26°C. The brewer uses his own culture for this. The original yeast strain, which Victor Moortgat himself selected in the 1920’s, originates from Scotland. After maturing in storage tanks in which the beer is cooled down to -2°C, the drink is ready for bottling. Thanks to the addition of extra sugars and yeast, the beer ferments again in the bottle. This occurs in warm cellars (24°C) and takes two weeks. Then the beer is moved to cold cellars, where it continues to mature and stabilise for a further six weeks. This extra long maturation period is unique and contributes to the refined flavour and pure taste of Duvel.",1,['Belgian Strong Pale Ale'],3.808

Brewer's Note
By doubling up on the amount of hops used, the Imperial version of India Pale Ale was born. The Imperial I.P.A. style is an expression of American craft brewing ingenuity that allows brewers to push the envelope of what beer can be. Infusing sweet mango compliments the amped-up bitter hop flavor, creating a complex yet refreshing beer.

It was also the beer served at the Original Oktoberfest celebration, which originated as a wedding reception for the King Ludwig I and Maria Theresa. Bavaria was a very poor country and had little cause for celebration, so the King and Queen invited the entire population of Bavaria to the reception. They showed up that year and every year thereafter, and the event evolved into the modern day Oktoberfest. Gordon Biersch Märzen accentuates the flavors of the dark roasted imported malted barley and exhibits a caramel malt aftertaste, while downplaying the hop level.

Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops weâ€™ve added. Lots and lots of them.

Ola Dubh (pronounced ‘ola-doo’ and Gaelic for ‘black oil’) was conceived in 2007. It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance. To make Ola Dubh 12, we take our Old Engine Oil (amped up to 10.5%) and age it for up to 6 months in casks that previously held Highland Park 12 Year Old single malt. And it is ready only when our head brewer, Stuart, deems it ready!

This amazing brew has been aged in selected oak casks formerly used to mature Highland Park 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky, adding complementary whisky notes to our chocolatey, bittersweet beer.

Ola Dubh 12 pours black with a modest spattered head that reduces slowly, leaving behind textbook lacing. The aroma is delicious; smoky Worcestershire sauce, leather, iodine and grilled steak. Flavours of smoky-sweet malts, roasted peat, coffee beans and a well-bittered finish. Overall this is a rather exotic brew with a defined barrel influence. It’s refined rather than over the top and very delicious indeed.

It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance. To make Ola Dubh 16, we take our Old Engine Oil (amped up to 10.5%) and age it for up to 6 months in casks that previously held Highland Park 16 Year Old single malt. And it is ready only when our head brewer, Stuart, deems it ready!

Aged in oak casks formerly used to mature Highland Park 16 Year Old Single Malt Whisky, our thick, gloopy base beer takes on distinct whisky notes, perfectly complementing its roasty, toasty bitterness.

Like the others, Ola Dubh 16 pours out jet black, with a small mocha-coloured head. There’s plenty to enjoy on the nose which is a classy blend of whisky, sweet roasted malts, earthy woodland and vanilla. The flavour is rich; loaded with sweet-roasted dark malts and coffee.

Designed to challenge the senses as well as perceptions, this is an easy-drinking, strong flavoured and spiced stout. The Aztecs and Mayans weren’t just masters of blow-darts, temples and predictions, they were also fans of chocolate, beer and smoked chillis. This beer has captured the imagination and the fans across the UK and in America, even gaining an honourable mention in the 2013 Brussels Beer Challenge. It is currently one of the top-ranked British brews on Untappd.

Taking you on a journey to South America, via Yorkshire, drinking this 6.5% Chipotle Chocolate Stout is a journey in itself. Rich heady chocolate on the nose, it’s all about deep luscious stouty goodness throughout with a soft mouthfeel. Just as a coffee bitterness develops, and you’re thinking that the party’s over, a subtle dry heat arrives that not only leaves your mouth tingling, but also thirsty and gasping for another taste. The Mayans smoked their chillis, and rather than brew with smoked malt, which can add to the bitterness, we used freshly smoked dried chipotle chillis to add an extra layer of flavour.

So when these dudes were invited to the Copenhagen Beer Celebration it was only natural for us to invite them to Amager also. And naturally the style chosen for our collaboration had to be a Farmhouse Saison, a style that Prairie has very much excelled at brewing. One of the Amager crew is still terribly ashamed of sleeping through a tornado warning at a motel room somewhere in Oklahoma years ago, so out of respect for the powers from above we named the beer ""Tulsa Twister"". As loud and frightening as a twister is, as cool and laid back are the dudes from Prairie. We had a great day of brewing and friendship - we hope it shows in the beer.

It is also lovely with meatballs, sausages, seafood and soft cheeses such as mozzarella. The beer itself should be very carefully poured into a typically tall slim glass slightly closed at the top, which keeps the rich and dense foamy head. Swirl the remaining beer in the bottle before finishing it to maximize the yeasty cloudiness. It can be served with a slice of lemon at a temperature of 6 - 8°C. It perhaps ranks among festive beers which even women savour, thanks to its not overly-bitter taste. It is becoming a trend.",1,['Hefeweizen'],3.572

And to many people words such as samba, football, romance, love, sun and beach seem to be what most easily comes to mind. However, naturally Brazil is so much more than bikini girls and beach bums. In the world of beer for instance Brazil is rapidly becoming a hotspot - not only in South America but in the world. Quality domestic craft brewers seem to pop up allover, and great beer imports are being brought into the country. Amager Bryghus is proud to have our beers available in Brazil and we're even prouder to present this collaboration done with 2cabeças - one of the finest of this new generation of Brazilian craft brewers.
The fruit of this joint venture ""Marry Me in Rio"" is intended to be light and crisp with an enticing hop profile that hopefully will quench your thirst and yet satisfy your need for a beer with character.

Fancy Lawnmower Beer is a world class brew yet light enough to be enjoyed by Texans after strenuous activities, like mowing the lawn. Saint Arnold Fancy Lawnmower Beer is best consumed at 35-45° Fahrenheit.

ご好評いただいた#002のビールを再仕込みです。発酵度、アルコール度数の調整、ホップの使用量の見直しをして、より本来のイメージに近いものに仕上げました。発酵度をやや抑えることにより、ウィートエールの特徴である丸みを帯びた柔らかな口当たりを表現しました。贅沢に使用したシトラのグレープフルーツを思わせる香りと相まって、ハイドリンカビリティな仕上がりです。

He was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.

The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.",1,['Lambic'],4.502

17106,Kapittel Dubbel,301,7.5,10,"
In our brewing process for the 7,5° dubbel we use extra winter malt .
This increase in malt results in a higher alcohol content, so the yeast that feeds on the sugars in the malt is given a feast of greater proportions.
By adding sugar, also known as “Belgian candy,” we can increase the activity of the yeast, and the beer gets a second fermentation in the bottle, carbonating the beer in a natural way.
This gives the beer a beautiful and large froth.

This fine Dubbel has a rich malt aroma of malt, yeast, dark fruit, & spice; flavors of sweet malt, yeast, caramel, dark fruit, raisons, and spice, with a faint touch of pleasant bitterness, and it fills up the gap between our 6° Pater and the 9° Prior

De vuurtoren is al 15 jaar het symbool van de Texelse Bierbrouwerij.

De bieren van Texels worden gebrouwen van uitsluitend natuurlijke grondstoffen zoals zuiver duinwater, Texelse gerst, hop en gist van de eigen Texels giststam. Ze zijn daarom erkend als ‘Echt Texels product’.

Texels Eyerlander is een amberbier met een warme, koperrode kleur door gebruik van diverse geroosterde moutsoorten. In de smaak zorgt het roosteren van de mout voor karamelachtige tonen.

The aroma is distinctly Belgian and has a hint of fruit. As with most Belgian beers, the hops are primarily used for bitterness and provide little to no flavor or aroma. We kept the malt bill relatively simple to allow each malt to come through in its own way without getting all muddled together. The caramel and chocolate malts, in particular, work well together and you can taste each of them in the beer. We also added a large amount of Belgian Extra Dark Candi Syrup during fermentation, which darkened the color, imparted dark fruit-like flavors, and boosted the alcohol. Despite its high strength though, the alcohol only comes out as a warmth on the back end but is not over powering. The aftertaste is slightly sweet but also has a dryness that makes you want more.

This beer is best enjoyed at 50°F to 55°F. ",1,['Belgian Quad'],4.087

How do you commemorate the start of a new chapter, a new dawn? A daunting task, we’re sure you’ll agree.

This is our answer. We do it with a big, muscular Winter Ale with a notable balanced bitterness. It is dark and rich with caramel and roasted sweetness. The hints of chocolate and coffee from the malt mesh with the liquorice tones from dark muscovado sugar and the berry fruitiness of UK Bramling Cross hops to profound effect.  A long, slightly warm fermentation with ale yeast produces fruity esters and a mildly warming alcohol aspect. Look out for a version which will be aged in American oak bourbon barrels where we hope the mosaic of flavours will increase even more in luxuriant complexity.

So, as we sit here in the cold Swedish winter enjoying the first fruits of our efforts in building this beautiful brewery, we can enjoy the comfort and contentment this dark Winter Ale provides.

The Japanese hops are kept company by some big-hitting Americans too and it's these – Chinook, Simcoe and Columbus – that seem most prominent within the subtle, citrusy aroma. It's late on in the flavour of this glowing copper beer that we picked up the Sorachi more, adding a dash of its herbal, lemon curd characteristics to proceedings.

But then comes a tingle followed by rejuvenating warmth, signs that something is different…something has changed…and for the better.

I feel stronger yet somehow more nimble and refined. I feel even more self-assured, and my vision for what is good and right, honest and true, is as laser-sharp as the brawny, bawdy, liquid Arrogance that shall further advance my battle against all things mediocre and geared toward the lowest common denominator. I have been born anew and, in the process, anointed with vibrant, inspiring, previously unexperienced character, all while maintaining everything I am and have always been—bold, bullish, unadulterated, and yes, Arrogant.

Pours a dark brown with hues of orange and red. Hints of molasses and brown sugar dominate the malty nose of this beer.

Schlenkerla Helles is boiled in the same copper kettles and bottom fermented by the same yeast as the historic Schlenkerla Smokebeer.

After long years of the beer community discussing hops to exhaustion, yeast is finally getting a glimpse of the spotlight following what seemed to be a lengthy Batman-like existence: outcast, living in the shadows, not getting enough credit for his work.  However, the importance of fermentation is no news to Chad from Crooked Stave, a.k.a. the king of Hipsters, who has been fondling with various fermenting agents for longer than most people have been drinking. So it was that on a beautiful – yet excruciatingly hungover – Wednesday Mr Yakobsen came to Amager to bombard us simpletons with his knowledge on all things yeasty, and especially, bretty. Due to stubbornness from our end, we still insisted the brew carried a motherf#&@ of hops, despite intents of a brett forward beer. The answer to what ingredient won the battle lies within this bottle. But in our opinion, we are all winners.

The word ‘stout’ means ‘proud and strong’ and refers to the drink being the strongest Porter and so was original called a Stout Porter. Over time the word Porter was dropped off the label and just became a Stout. We see a Stout as being high in intensity, bold, complex yet well balanced and silky in the mouth. Prominent flavours are of dark fruits, like Prunes and Figs, Toasted Coffee Beans and Chocolate. Yes we are very ‘stout’ about our Stout!!

Dit bier met een link naar de historie is in maart op Texel geïntroduceerd ter gelegenheid van de viering van 600 jaar stadsrechten. Tijdens de Dutch Beer Challenge in maart 2015 werd Texels Donkerd I.P.A. door de experts bekroond met zilver in de categorie 'Innovatie'. 

I.P.A. staat voor India Pale Ale. Dit biertype stamt uit de tijd dat met zeilschepen naar ‘de Oost’ werd gevaren.  ‘De Reede van Texel’ was voor die schepen een belangrijke ankerplaats. Hier werd gewacht op gunstige wind en gebunkerd voor de reis. Ook bier ging mee aan boord. Het I.P.A. dat de beroemde zeevaarders uit de Gouden Eeuw meenamen, was goed houdbaar door de extra hop die werd toegevoegd tijdens het brouwproces.

De toegevoegde hop is nog steeds kenmerkend voor dit biertype. In Texels Donkerd I.P.A. wordt hop vers verwerkt tijdens het brouwproces. Dit geeft een fruitige geur en een smaak die doet denken aan grapefruit, ananas en mango. Gebrande mout zorgt voor de donkere kleur en smaaktonen van koffie en karamel. De moutbitterheid is een mooie aanvulling op de voor een I.P.A. kenmerkende hopbitterheid.

IN THE MASH
U.S. Pale, Maris Otter Pale, Crystal, Black Patent, Coffee Malt & Chocolate Malt

IN THE BOIL
Challenger & East Kent Golding Hops

SPECIAL INGREDIENTS
Lactose, Flaked Oats, Coffee, Vanilla, Pasilla Peppers, Nutmeg, Cinnamon & Cocoa

AGED 
3 Months in American Oak Kentucky Bourbon Barrels

CELLAR NOTES
Time spent in bourbon barrels gave an already complex beer even more complexity and flavor intensity, layering additional caramel-like and vanilla flavors on top of those already present. Aromas of rich coffee and dark chocolate are followed by nutmeg and cinnamon; a lush, heavy mouthfeel laden with charred oak and toffee engulfs the palate on the first sip. Lingering pasilla pepper and soft oak flavors persist through an exceptionally long finish in this intensely rich and satisfying beer.

en Málaga. Diez años después, durante un viaje a Alemania, 
creó un personaje; el típico turista alemán, situado en 
un entorno malagueño. Entonces no imaginó que tanto 
el personaje como su cerveza llegarían a convertirse 
en los símbolos más representativos de Málaga, 
de lo exquisito de sus costumbres y de su gracia.

CERVEZA VICTORIA se elabora mediante el procedimiento
tradicional de maduración lenta con un mínimo de 2 semanas de
guarda que asegura la elevada calidad del producto. Es dorada
y brillante, con burbujas finas y abundantes. Suave, con densas notas de cereales tostados y eminentemente fresca.

En nariz presenta un toque de fruta madura y mucho olor a levaduras 
que le dan carácter. Aromas que recuerdan a los frutos secos como 
la avellana y la almendra. En boca, muy especiada, con un perfecto 
equilibrio dulzor-amargor, que le otorga un sabor exquisito. 
Un final torrefacto que invita a volver a degustarla.

Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.

Not soured but just that little nod towards a lambic beer. Very roasty and very bitter. That bitterness mellows over time in the bottle but if you are lucky enough to get an Imperial Russian on draught it will be full on. The style is not intended to be overtly hoppy once settled but obviously with so many hops used the draught experience will have something on the hop front that won’t be there in a bottled version.

A rich, dark spiced ale, our secret recipe is different every year—as is the tree on the label—but the intent remains the same: joy and celebration of the newness of life.

Since ancient times, trees have symbolized the winter solstice when the earth, with its seasons, appears born anew. Our tree for 2012 is the Norfolk Island pine. Captain Cook discovered this South Seas isle and its native tree in 1774. These tropical-looking conifers, which thrive in sandy soil and coastal climes, were first planted in California in the 1850s. The Norfolk Island pine on this year’s label, hand drawn from life, resides in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park.

Each year our Christmas Ale gets a unique label and a unique recipe. Although our recipes must remain a secret, many save a few bottles from year to year. Properly refrigerated, the beer remains intriguing and drinkable for years. Different nuances emerge as the flavor mellows slightly, much like the memories of great holiday seasons past.

KATARINAS FAVORIT
Ölen du håller i din hand är Russian Imperial Stout. Under 1700-talet var denna ölstil en favorit hos Katarina den stora och ryska hovet. Vår version kännetecknas av en rejäl kropp, generös doft och smak av lakrits, kaffe och choklad samt lite hetta från alkoholen i avslutet.

""Jag har jobbat mycket med olika kombinationer av malt för att få ut rejält med doft och smak. I slutresultatet fick vi till en skön komplexitet och en härligt mjuk kropp."" -Daniel Granath, bryggmästare",1,['Stout - Russian Imperial'],3.836

Long before the wizardry of steam was invented, brewers used stone and wood to brew their daily beer. They built a fire to heat large stones until they were hot enough to be added to their wooden vats to create a boiling brew. Apart from the obvious heating effects, the brewing stones also caramelised the brew to create subtle but rich toffee like flavours.

We have a perfectly good boiler, but it is those intense malt flavours from caramelising the wort that we have gone to great lengths to create. ",1,['Winter Ale'],3.853

A blend of Motueka, Wakatu, Pacifica, Topaz and Pacific Gem hops from Australia and New Zealand, emerges from the malt foundation and blossoms into a sublime burst of flavors like citrus fruits, succulent melons and flowery herbs.  More of the same in the nose, but the aroma wafts together into a bouquet of tropical flowers.  Though aggressively hopped, this IPA is not overly bitter and promotes a dangerously session-like aspect that belies it’s 7% ABV.

Marketing Description:  It’s not just your senses beguiling you. When the Phantasmic appears, prepare yourself for an ethereal blend of notable hints of fruit and pine, reaching out to you from beyond the shadows of rich yeast and hops.

Tokyo* is a beer inspired by a 1980's space invaders arcade game played in Japan's capital.

The irony of existentialism, the parody of being and the inherent contradictions of post-modernism, all so delicately conveyed by the blocky, pixelated arcade action have all been painstakingly recreated in this bottles contents.

This imperial stout is brewed with copious amounts of speciality malts, jasmine and cranberries. After fermentation we then dry-hop this killer stout with a bucketload of our favourite hops before carefully ageing the beer on French toasted oak chips.

It is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times.

You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.

Born in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.

The grain bill includes a healthy portion of wheat, while light hopping lend citrus & herbal notes to the aroma. Fermented with Bell’s house ale yeast, Oarsman comes in at 4.0% alcohol by volume.

Known as ‘Hefe Weizen’, it's pale, unfiltered and very lightly hopped. Yeast used is a particular strain that contributes unique aromas of cloves, banana and even that rather alarming pink bubble gum that anyone over forty might remember from their childhood.
It's the minimalist of beer and the key note to making it is restraint! Now imagine the scene….it’s a hot day in February. The suns a shining and the beanbags are filling nicely with thirsty people. But none as thirsty as you. You’ve done a big walk, perhaps been out fishing or mowing the lawn. So you do the sensible thing and ask for a Wheat .

En succes som ikke er funderet på hype eller varm luft, men ganske enkelt på kvaliteten af øllet.

High starch and protein grains are used in more than one step in the brewing process to guarantee not just body, but that trademark haze we have come to expect from the Northeast. We went for a far more aromatic yeast ester profile than normal, contributing complimentary scents of over-ripe peaches falling from the tree. Low bitterness and an over-the-top dry hopping of Citra and Mosaic hops keep this beer in line with our typical Fieldwork flavor profile. The hops meld together to create an aggressive aroma that smells like a drive through a citrus orchard in peak of season.

The malty sweetness, fruitiness, unique hop aroma and high original gravity of Old Foghorn® Barleywine Style Ale is to beer much as port is to wine. 

Old Foghorn® is brewed based on traditional English barleywine methods. It is highly hopped, fermented with a true top-fermenting ale yeast, carbonated by a natural process called ""bunging"" to produce champagne-like bubbles, and dry-hopped with additional Cascade hops while it ages in our cellars. Made only from “first wort,” the rich first runnings of an all-malt mash, three mashes are required to produce just one barleywine brew.

Introduced in 1975, Old Foghorn® Ale was the first modern American barleywine sparking renewed interest domestically and in Britain. The name was derived from the English tradition of attaching the word “old” to barleywines to denote their tradition, intensive brewing process and cellar aging, and “Foghorn” gave it a San Francisco flair. Today, Old Foghorn® Ale is best enjoyed sipped after a meal.",5,['Barleywine - English'],3.66

Sam Calagione, from Dogfish Head Brewery, one of the most well-known American brewers, came to Borgorose to create and brew a special beer in collaboration with us. We chose a style: a Pilsner. But obviously not a regular one... we designed a something stronger, around 7 % ABV and of course it had to be hoppy!

We choose the malt: Pilsner and Cara-Pils. Easy! Sam chooses two hops, Simcoe and Warrior, I choose the third one: Saaz. Traditional and new ingredients together.

We start the mash, then we lauter and start the boil, the crowning moment. Before the boil started Sam mixed the hops creating a wonderfully perfumed potion. Once the mix was ready we started hopping. A fistful of hops was added every minute for 60 minutes... The result? An intriguing beer, extremely perfumed, where floral and resiny notes mix together.

The mouth feel is explosive but balanced at the same time. The honey notes form the malts and the peppery ones from the hops mix in a very elegant and precise finish. I can't stop drinking it, it's my new favorite....",1,"['Pilsner - Imperial', 'Double']",3.868

Food Pairings: The bracing bitterness of this beer can hold its own with spicy foods, while helping to cleanse the palate after rich, creamy dishes. The citrus hop flavors go exceptionally well with any dishes using cilantro, such as Mexican salsas.

Au lieu de choisir d'y apposer une étiquette qui pourrait se décoller ou s'effacer avec les années, nous avons choisi de la faire sérigraphier afin qu'elle puisse perdurer.

When we weren’t experimenting with hop combinations and tasting test batches, we asked ourselves these important questions while developing Top Rope, our new IPA that pays homage to the colorful, character-filled world of 1980s and 1990s professional wrestling.

Well, let me tell you somethin’, brother, this beer’s got hops! Like a high-flying elbow drop from the turnbuckle to deliver a finishing move, Top Rope IPA combines power and finesse, with strong hop punch and a dry finish. Top Rope is an IPA that’ll call you back into the ring for multiple rematches.

6.3% abv Smoked IPA

Bacon is so nice we have partnered with Freedom Farms who have made a bacon and beer sausage which we will be serving at Beervana with this beer.

A surprising first sip, the smokey bacon character drops back after a few tastes. The colour is a very bright burnish orange copper. The aroma is sweet yet smokey. The taste is smokey bacon with sweet caramel malt, kind of like candied bacon in a glass.

Ola Dubh (pronounced ‘ola-doo’ and Gaelic for ‘black oil’) was conceived in 2007. It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance.

Consistent with the core Ola Dubh range, the 1991 Vintage is deep dark brown, dense and oily; the nose is redolent of soy and molasses with winey overtones and a gentle, earthy, hop aroma. The 1991 Vintage is somewhat sweeter than its counterparts and has delicious smoky-sherry notes on the palate, the flavours deriving at least as much from the whisky-infused-wood as the spirit itself.

This winter beer speaks to the beauty and necessity of remembering to look behind while always moving ahead.

In winter, stillness falls over landscapes, all is hushed by snow, and the silence brings us to a welcome halt. The weariness of the world  rejoices, and we return to the first things: the homes of our youth, the family table, the shared stories embellished, not diminished, by time.
The silent night is shattered by the cadence of winter's joy, and we are remade into the glory we once were. Fear is displaced by peace and mirth. 
In winter, the first things become the only things.",1,['American Wild Ale'],4.169

This is our Saint Patrick’s Day Seasonal and will pour exclusively on our ‘Nitro’ taps the entire month of March. McMenamins Irish Stout is our interpretation of the internationally renowned beer style that originated in Ireland and was popularized by legendary brewing institutions, such as Guinness, Murphy’s and Beamish. Historically speaking, the style emerged early in the 19th century from attempts by Irish brewers to capitalize on the success of London porters. To cut costs, unmalted (and therefore, untaxed at the time) roasted barley was used, which imparted a unique and distinctively different coffee-like bitterness to the flavor and aroma of the ale. Thus, a new beer style was born.

McMenamins Irish Stout is made as traditionally as possible with our own little twist. It is a very dark, ebony-colored stout with a thick, creamy and long lasting head. The flavor is a fantastic fusion of coffee-like roasted barley bitterness and semi-sweet chocolate. A moderate hop bitterness balances pleasingly with this hearty backbone, while tiny nitrogen bubbles enhance the sensation on your taste buds with a smooth, silky creaminess. One sip will have your head in the Emerald Isle clouds. A touch of the Irish, the blessings of St. Patrick and a pint of McMenamins Irish Stout to you!",1,['Stout - Irish Dry'],3.696

It seems beautifully poetic that from our location in the old ‘Luma’ lightbulb factory, in fact on the street called Ljusslingan (meaning string of lights), that we can produce this beer designed specifically to lighten up everyone’s winter.

‘Ljusslingan’ is based on a traditional German Schwarzbier, and as is usual from a Nya Carnegie beer, we have given this style a modern, innovative twist. Although fermented as a lager, the main driver of the malt flavour is provided by caramelized and roasted malts from Bavaria. This deep russet brown beer has an easy, snappy bitterness and a quick finish with lingering malt roast tones and tropical fruit notes from a late hop addition of the Pacific Northwest hop blend Falconer’s Flight.

大好評だった#006 Hey!パイナポー!の再仕込みです。が、レシピを見直しバランスを取り直しています。カラメルモルトの比率をやや高め、また仕込み方法を変えることによって、前バッチより口当たりが柔らかくなるように調整しました。
前バッチ同様、フレッシュパイナップルを一つ一つ手で下処理した果肉をタンクに漬け込むことによってジューシーなパイナップルのアロマと、酸味を引き出しています。
全バッチのパイナップルを切ったのは、うしとらスタッフのエツロウでしたが、なんと今回は2名の若い女性（匿名希望）が手伝って切ってくれました。そのため、より一層ジューシーさが増している。かもしれません。ただし”甘くない”というコンセプトは前バッチから変えず、果汁もしっかりと発酵させ、あくまでもビールとしてのバランスを取るよう心がけています。
なお、ビール名の”夏しちゃってる☆BOY”のイメージキャラクターはうしとらスタッフのエツロウです。

We really admire the profile of this new style but wanted a session strength version. We brewed ours at 4.5% instead of the typical 8%+, but wanted to retain the unique flavour profile. We sourced the special malt required from Germany and the hops from America to create a beer of stunning depth and complexity. The beer is black in appearance but lacks the acrid flavours associated with all other dark beers. This is achieved through use of the special German malt. The hop aromas and flavours are very intense, which we achieve through a major dose of dry-hopping in the cask. The result is a beer that wraps all the wonderful hop profiles of a pale ale inside a silky black exterior. It is truly an Illusion that deceives your eyes and dazzles your taste buds. Due to the rare nature of these special ingredients it is a limited release beer, but we are looking at making it more regularly available if possible.",2,"['Ipa - Black', 'Cascadian Dark Ale']",3.743

The big floral, herbal hop aroma is followed by refreshingly bold bitterness and elegantly rounded malt flavours.

Many brewers believe that certain beers are at their best when drunk straight from maturation tank before filtration. We want to give everyone the chance to taste it this way and see if we are right. A pure culture Bavarian yeast strain gives the beer a slight haze in the glass and the very essence of freshness that make this beer stand out from the crowd.

5940,Leffe Blonde / Blond,5,6.6,20,"In the fifties, an extraordinary meeting took place that all beer enthusiasts should raise their glass of Leffe to.   The abbey’s Father Abbot Nys became acquainted with Albert Lootvoet, a master brewer.  Passionate about the future of the brewery, Father Nys was upset to have to witness how, since the unpleasant stay of the French revolutionaries, the brewery had slowly fallen into decline and had eventually had to close its doors in 1809. Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour…and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond – a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed.

Leffe Blond is the flagship of Leffe. The unique recipe is the fruit of centuries of experience in the art of brewing, which brings a broad palette of aromas into balance. It is elegant, smooth and fruity, and it has a spicy aftertaste with a hint of bitter orange. Its light, sunny colour is due to the use of pale malt. Leffe Blond contains 6.6 % alcohol and fits excellently with a wide variety of dishes. It is best at a temperature of 5° to 6° Celsius.

A beautiful, deep copper brown ale. It has a full, malty body with hints of chocolate, a touch of sweetness and a light hop flavor. A complex malt character is created by combining five different types of malts. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace. The light fruitiness, characteristic of ales, is derived from a proprietary yeast strain.

Saint Arnold Ale Wagger Brown is best consumed at 45-50° Fahrenheit.

IPA is our go-to style here at BrewDog; from Punk to Hardcore, Jack Hammer to Atlantic IPA, we have majored in bringing you as many hop-forward beers to you as is humanly possible.

We wanted to brew a completely new and conceptual IPA that paid tribute to the style’s origins whilst incorporating the devastatingly modern techniques and technologies. A 21st Century drink with an 18th Century ethos; a very new yet very old IPA.

We found our inspiration from a doctor. The ‘father of Pharmacology’ Dr Jonathan Pereira to be precise. In 1843 he published a book which shook the establishment. Titled ‘A Treatise on Food and Diet’.

Screw any semblance of balance. This beer is like injecting hops straight into your tongue with a needle. Inspired by that other great era for India Pale Ales, the mid-nineteenth Century, Restorative Beverage is going to be impossible to remonstrate with, or counter.

We then inocculated a barrel of our own Russian Imperial Stout – TSAR with this precious sludge and left the beer to its own devices for 9 months. The only attention this beer got from us was a weekly roll-around-the-brewery, just like the Courage Hogsheads got.

Following this 9 month ageing, the beer that we now tasted had changed in character remarkably. The familiar landmarks were still there – huge body, chocolate, molases, but now there was so much more. The Brettanomyces strain of yeast that had laid dormant in the bottle all those years had re-awakened when dispersed amongst our young, fresh Imperial Stout, and had gone to work with vigour.

Celis White has been revived by Michigan Brewing Company with the blessing of its founder and his daughter, Christine Celis. The original Celis White, brewed in Austin, TX by Pierre Celis during the early and mid 1990’s, ceased production when Mr. Celis closed his Austin microbrewery and moved to Belgium.

In 2002, Michigan Brewing Company acquired Celis, and Celis beers were back in production. Michigan Brewing continued the production of Celis beers until its closure in 2012. In June 2012, the Celis trademark made its way back to the Celis family. In 2014, Christine Celis began having Pierre Celis’ original recipes brewed at Two Roads Brewery in Connecticut.

FORMER HISTORY (Belgium)
Pierre Celis created the original Hoegaarden beer in the early 1960’s. Interbrew-Labatt bought the brand and the brewery in the 1980's. Pierre Celis formed a new brewery in Austin Texas, brewing the same beer but under the brand name Celis White. Miller bought the Celis brewery and the Celis White brand-name in 1996. The brewery closed in 2000. In late 2002 Michigan Brewing bought the Celis White brand from Miller. Brouwerij Van Steenberge is now brewing the original Pierre Celis White under the brand-name Celis White in Europe and Ertveld's Wit in North America.

Snowsuit ale is a spiced Belgian Abbey ale, brewed in the traditional style that goes back centuries, but with a fresh spin.

1095017,Arizona Beast,1950,7,203,"The rumour was started by the Arizona Department of Transportation: a suspicious looking ""thing"" was spotted on some highway cam in one of the most remote areas of the Grand Canyon state. Was it a yeti, was it a sasquatch or was it Big Foot? Since then the hunt has been on for the now infamous Arizona Beast - dusty, spiky and - of course - bearded. We have chosen to believe that it's out there - somewhere.
Bearded indeed were Arizona Wilderness brewers Jonathan Buford and Patrick Ware when they came to brew at Amager - after a small morning detour to Sweden or Norway or somewhere…admittedly European geography CAN be confusing. It was a day of good fun, laughter, drinking and a little brewing. We hope you'll enjoy our baby beast of an Oatmeal IPA.
P.S.: a final piece of good advice: should you ever get the chance, do NOT try to keep up with the Wilderness boys when it comes to drinking beer or hard liquor. Many a person have tried - and failed miserably.

Ola Dubh (pronounced ‘ola-doo’ and Gaelic for ‘black oil’) was conceived in 2007. It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance.

This amazing brew has been aged in selected oak casks formerly used to mature Highland Park 40 Year Old Single Malt Whisky, adding complementary whisky notes to our chocolatey, bittersweet beer.

Ola Dubh 40 pours black with a small tan head. On the nose there’s some intensely dark, melted chocolate, hints of hardwood smoke and a touch of saltiness. In addition to the chocolate, coffee and oaky notes embodied in the flavour of its younger siblings, you’ll pick up some over-ripe berries, polished leather, possibly a cigar leaf and a lovely, gently-peppered spice.

It’s not how much you put in – it’s what you do with it that counts. There are so many factors involved that culminate in that snappy, fresh hop character that we all love about the US inspired pale ales. Selecting the hop varieties (even the farms at which they are grown), blending them together in just the right proportions, keeping both the hops in our hop store and the finished beer free from the staling effects of oxygen and balancing all this with a moreish dry malty body.

Although there is no expense spared in choosing the right malts to give the beer a pale, dry, biscuit malt flavour, let’s face it – the hops are the star of the show. We have selected a combination of UK Admiral and US Willamette and Bravo hops to give orangey citrus and resinous piney notes. Our concept was to provide the same hop hit that hopheads crave from ‘bigger’ US style IPAs in a more elegant sessionable strength beer. We think we have succeeded.

Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.

We trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…

BIIR combina en una sola recepta la tradició de les Witbier belgues amb la innovació de les IPA americanes.

Un volum important de maltes d’ordi i blat d’origen centreeuropeu li donen cos i una graduació alcohòlica per sobre del que és habitual en una Wit. Dels llúpols procedents d’Austràlia i Nord-amèrica n’obté aromes i sabors afruitats, amb la dosi precisa d’amargor que la converteixen, també, en una cervesa refrescant. Tres tipus diferents de pell de taronja biològica i el coriandre li aporten els matisos aromàtics del Mediterrani.

La BIIR White IPA és una cervesa artesana, re-fermentada en ampolla,  sense filtrar ni pasteuritzar, per això manté un pòsit de llevat al fons de l’ampolla que recomanem no servir per no alterar el seu sabor.

The first BIIR, in collaboration with Gunther Besnch, is a beer with the touch of Barcelona. It has a cosmopolitan, innovative and creative spirit, as does the city.

The same spirit that sent pathfinders, like Captain Cook, sailing from Britain to the shores of Australia and the rocky coastlines of Alaska animates today's trailblazers. Wherever you find a frontier, be it the Final Frontier of our Milky Way, the Last Frontier of the Great Land, or the frontiers of scientific knowledge, there you will also find dedicated men and women, taking risks to break trail for the rest of us.

One of the new trails being blazed on the frontier of beer is the style known as White India Pale Ales. Galaxy White IPA represents a significant new landmark on that trail. With its use of fresh kumquats, Indian coriander, and black peppercorns, Galaxy pays homage to the early explorers, who sailed unknown seas in search of rare spices and exotic fruits. Captain Cook travelled from Australia to Alaska, and so have the Galaxy hops used to create this adventurous brew. Just as a true explorer never stands still, the presence of brettanomyces guarantees that Galaxy White IPA will keep evolving in the bottle for years to come.

So take a step from the known into the unknown. Cross the frontier from the commonplace into the extraordinary. Be the first to gaze upon an undiscovered country and return to tell the tale to those timid souls you left behind.

If you take a casual stroll along the fair coastline of Gotland, you might wonder if there are any forests on the island at all. But make no mistake about it. Deep and dark, they are, and twisted – the pine forests of this storied isle. There are many legends of these woods, and one that is centuries old tells of a monster attracted to the smell of smoke from campfires. A friendly monster, but still… Many a camper has wet his pants upon discovering the Marshmallow Monster hovering over the dying embers trying to toast a perfect skewerful of sweets for his cocoa. We first heard tell of the Marshmallow Monster from our friends at Malmö Brygghus, so it was only natural to make our collaboration brew a homage to this kind Swedish creature. For we believe in the goodness of all men – and monsters.

Hvis man blot færdes langs Gotlands smukke kyster, kan man måske komme i tvivl om, hvorvidt der overhovedet findes skove på øen. Men jo, tag ikke fejl. Dybe, mørke og forblæste er de - fyrretræs-skovene på denne sagnomspundne ø. Og netop et af disse århundreder år gamle sagn beretter om et monster fra skoven, som lokkes frem ved lugten af bålrøg. Om end et særdeles venligt monster. Gennem årene har ikke så få skovcampister fået sig en overraskelse, når de i en sen nattetime har opdaget monsteret med sin marshmallowpind siddende ved gløderne af lejrbålet i et forsøg på at riste den perfekte skumfidus.

Among the orchards and pastures of the green and pleasant Somerset countryside you’ll find our unusual brewery. Our neighbours at Westcombe Dairy make one of the finest Cheddars in the world and Madness balances its intensity and flavours perfectly.

Our Madness IPA uses four classic American hops renowned for their citrus and resinous characteristics. Amarillo, Citra, Centennial and Columbus – used somewhat liberally in late hop and dry hop additions – make this beer what it is. We use a very simple malt bill, and a yeast with a very low flavour impact so that the hops can really shine.

It was first brewed in 1997 shortly after which (and unrelated to the new brew) a wee fracas broke out in the brewhouse. Feathers flew. There was some colourful language. One or more wives may have been involved. Nobody can remember exactly who was called ""bitter & twisted"", by whom, or even why! But it was one heck of a name-day for this great beer!

Jungle Juice is a double IPA powerfully hopped by only late additions. Once in the fermenter the beer is then dry-hopped for several rounds in a process which filters the beer through a fully-loaded hop rocket. We use hops which we think fit the style  best, which results in an incredibly refreshing beer with noticeable tropical-fruity hop aromas.

De bieren van Texels worden gebrouwen van uitsluitend natuurlijke grondstoffen zoals zuiver duinwater, Texelse gerst, hop en gist van de eigen Texels giststam. Ze zijn daarom erkend als ‘Echt Texels product’.

Voor Texels Goudkoppe gaan de brouwers te werk volgens de eeuwenoude tradities van het 'Bayerische Reinheitsgebot', een Duitse regeling die geldt als de oudste warenwet ter wereld. De oorsprong ligt sinds 1516 in het hertogdom Beieren. Volgens dit gebod mocht bier alleen gemout graan, water en hop bevatten. Gist was toen nog niet ontdekt en komt daarom niet voor in het oorspronkelijke Reinheitsgebot.

Named after the Sorachi region of Hokkaido, Japan, the Sorachi Ace hop was developed by a large Japanese brewery in the late 1970s. A cross between British Brewers Gold, Japanese “Beikei No. 2” and the famed Czech Saaz, it had a unique lemony, herbal scent, but this hop was deeemed ""odd"" and ended up quickly banished to a laboratory.
In 2008, the Sorachi Ace hop was quietly revived by a family farm in Washington State. Less than a year later, we made it the star of its own titular beer. Originally a member of our limited Brewmaster’s Reserve series, Brooklyn Sorachi Ace is a beer we just couldn’t let disappear. Brooklyn Sorachi Ace is a classic saison, an unfiltered golden farmhouse ale, with a clean malt flavor and the quirky Sorachi Ace hop standing front and center. Dry-hopping releases Sorachi Ace’s bright, spicy aromatics to tickle the nose before ascending into a fine harmony between pilsner malt and playful Belgian ale yeast.

Brooklyn Sorachi Ace is sunshine in a glass, a shining example of the versatility of one of the world’s most intriguing hops. This beer is a superstar at the table, and we enjoy it with seafood dishes, fresh cheeses, poultry, barbecue, and even tomato-based pasta sauces.

The moon projected its reddish glow on Saint Rumbold’s tower, which was wrapped in a dense fog. “Fire, fire, the tower is on fire!” shouts the dreary voice of a drunken man. The alarm was sounded and people were making haste to help extinguish the so-called fire. Before the tower was reached, the moon slowly moved through the fog. From that moment on, the Mechelenians are called the Maneblussers or “Moonextinguishers”.",1,"['Blonde Ale - Belgian Blonde', 'Golden']",3.485

We needed more complexity, so we made it surreally smoky with cherry-wood smoked malts.

Let’s be clear: the beer is still the same, a ‘top-notch’ IPA that has been enthusiastically received by impassioned craft beer drinkers.

So, what’s in a name? Beyond the appeal of not straying far from the use of “Hop Notch”, Uinta embraced their inner foodie realizing that “Nosh” was an excellent fit for this beer– so big in unique hop character that it is literally a hoppy snack.

The “Hop Notch” to “Hop Nosh” transition will roll out with the new year. In the midst of an expansion, a really exciting time at Uinta, it only took one sip of Hop Nosh for the Uinta team to digest the change and move on. Uinta hopes that the craft beer

community will embrace the transformation as Uinta has. Most importantly, within each bottle, can and keg lives the same IPA: drinkable, consistent, clean and hop-forward. Cheers to great beer, the camaraderie of the craft beer industry, and to Hop Nosh. May it always be perceived as a ‘top-notch IPA’.

One of them was a pale ale hopped with a variety I had never had before – Riwaka from New Zealand. From the first mouthful I knew I had to brew with that hop. I was on the phone the next day with the hop merchants, but it would not be coming to the UK for another 10 months. I checked back often, even tracking the progress of the boat as it approached (delayed, of course!).
My memory of the power of that hop was so vivid. I did not want to have it compete for flavour with coloured malts, but there needed to be a balancing malt flavour to enhance drinkability. I managed to source a low coloured cara malt – difficult to malt, difficult to crush and very inefficient to work with, but adding good body and some honeyed sweetness. Rather than use traditional pale malt I went with a lighter lager malt to both lighten the colour and alter the malt profile.
Hops from New Zealand apparently come super-vac packed. The package was about half the size of a normal bag for the same weight. I hesitantly opened the bag, hoping my memory wasn’t all roses. And I was far from disappointed! Uncle Fester was at the other end of the brewery about 50 metres away and could smell them from there even before I pulled the hops out of the bag. We still talk about that as one of our defining brewing moments. The brew day proceeded as normal until the transfer of the wort to the fermenter.

The first addition is the must of viognier grapes that have been infected with a benevolent fungus called botrytis. This 'noble rot' reduces the water content in the grapes while magnifying their sweetness and complexity.

The second is a pinot gris intensified by a process called 'dropping fruit,' where large clusters of grapes are clipped to amplify the quality and distinction of those left behind.

Kriek Max is made from a mixture of bottom-fermented and spontaneously fermented beer (also called foeder beer). The perfect combination of cherries, natural juices and aromas on the one hand and the basic beer on the other hand lends this kriek not only its excellent flavour, but also its pleasant smell.

The base concept “more flavour” is clearly linked to the word “max” suggesting maximum flavour and thus creating a clear product image.

This is one of our favourite North American hops used as a blend in the Armadillo and our black IPA (rich in citrus, earthy pine, tropical fruit, herbal and stone fruit notes). This beer has a tonne of flavour, derived from a distinct yeast character and generous amount of dry hopping. ‘Juicy’ comes to mind when describing this beer. We allowed the beer to free rise in fermentation. This means rather than fermenting at a controlled temperature (usually around 20 degrees c), the yeast is allowed to go crazy, climbing up to around 30 degrees c – the idea here being that a warmer fermentation produces much more of the fruit and spice esters that characterise a Saison yeast. It also helps to produce a dry finish in the beer (1.009) which ultimately brings a nice bit of balance to those big, juicy fruit flavours. Mosaic works beautifully well in this beer; favoured this time for its heavily aromatic character but with a much more rounded fruit profile &#40;think tropical, soft fruits, berry etc&#41; than most big American hop varieties. As for the malt – nice and light, a bit of oats and wheat for mouth-feel and head retention, but kept simple enough to let the hops and yeast do most of the talking. Dangerously drinkable at 6.7%…

For the 2015 version, we were able to get our hands on a brand new hop, called Snap, which is actually a blend of hops, spices and botanicals. What exactly is in there? We can't say. How do you blend hops with spices and botanicals? We can't say. We can tell you that the new hop, added at the end of fermentation, adds a ginger snap aroma and a complexity that makes Sailing Santa taste like the holidays.

Our Sailing Santa is pure, with no additives or preservatives. In order to maintain the freshest flavor possible, we do not pasteurize our beer. Many of its subtle flavors are delicate and would not stand up to the heat of pasteurization. We recommend that this product be stored cold to avoid any degradation in flavor. You will notice that the spice notes decrease over time.",1,['Winter Warmer'],3.801

Type in BATCH
Moscatel 67%
Brandy 8%
Oloroso 8%
New Oak Medium Toast 8%
New Oak High Toast 8%
This Oak Aged is copper brown in colour and its aroma is a mixture of muscatel aromas and Quadrupel. In addition to sweet honey, flowery meadows with almond and caramel, we also distinguish the aroma of muscatel wine and, of course, that of oak. This Quadrupel too has been lagered in barriques, most of which are burned on the inside. Out of all batches released so far, this batch has the smokiest and fullest flavour. The influence of Oloroso and Brandy barrels also has a distinct side-effect. Ultimately, the complex flavour is full, smooth and balanced.

Our original golden 4.5%, Heaven Sent was an excellent example of a midlands style lightly hopped golden ale, however we decided that tastes were changing and that a more characterful beer was required.

1291950,Projekt 007 Imperial Saison Svarta Vinbär,46930,8,30,"Saison, som betyder säsong på franska, bryggdes ursprungligen av bönder i de fransktalande delarna av Belgien. Man använde de råvaror som fanns tillgängliga för stunden, vilket gjorde att karaktären kunde variera en hel del från gård till gård. Vissa år kunde det råda brist på råvaror och man fick dryga ut med till exempel örter eller bär. Något vi tagit fasta på i vår tolkning - svart vinbärssaison. De ingredienser som sätter störst prägel på vår saison är jästen och vinbären. Ett utmärkande drag för jästen är att den jäser ut förhållandevis mycket. Det innebär att ölet blir relativt torrt med hög kolsyrehalt. Den torrheten, tillsammans med smaken från vinbären, ger ölet en lätt vinös ton.",1,"['Saison', 'Farmhouse Ale']",3.595

Many of you likely remember our previous flirtation with an ale of the Blonde persuasion, and while it served its purpose and we moved on. It turns out that we couldn't slake our thirst without a good-time Blonde.

However, our tastes in Blondes have changed a bit since our initial offering. The spirit is still similar, but we've revamped the hopping schedule and are introducing a very new hop variety, Meridian, which is rich in fruitiness, with a very mellow, even profile compared to many of the newer super high alpha hop varieties. Our Blonde is certainly in the American tradition and borrows its hop forward character from the subset known as Extra Pale Ale (XPA) and has the body some of the grainy character of a Pale American Wheat.

560890,Sleipner,20859,9.4,304,"India Pale Ale, IPA, is an English beer that was developed around 1840 with the goal to sail beer to the English colony, India. The British officers missed their pale ale from back home, however the beer could not handle the temperature fluctuations on the long journey from the British Isles, past Africa and to India. The British brewers therefore created a type of beer that was able to cope with the stress from the journey by preserving it with higher alcohol, lots of hops and a new style was invented. An Imperial India pale ale is developed in the USA and is brewed with even stronger new American hops and more alcohol. Sleipner is brewed with five carefully selected and very powerful American hop varieties and is for those who cannot get enough hops. A hop bomb of bitterness and aroma. Fermented at a slightly lower temperature which allows the yeast notes to promote the various hop varieties complexity and aroma. Should be enjoyed at 10-12°C, (50-54°F).

Sleipner is Odin’s eight-legged stallion. It can run fast like the wind and moves just as well in the air and on the ground. Sleipner mother is Loki, which transformed into a mare to lure the jötnar stallion Svadilfare away from his work to build the wall around Asgard.

It was brewed in honour of Karl Friedrich Rehbinder, the founder of Estonian beer culture and of Saku Brewery.

Karl is a real beer, exactly as genuine Estonian beer used to be for centuries before modern times. There is no innovative crystal filtration or luxurious aroma bouquet, no posh hop cultivars or trendy freshness. This beer only includes barley malt, water, hops, yeast and the experience gathered by Saku brew masters over centuries.

Traditional raw materials and brewing technologies create a beer that combines the bitterness of hops and the sweet hint of barley malt. A genuine and pure taste to be enjoyed by those who appreciate the charm of simplicity.

Malts: Roasted Soba, Metcalf, C-15, Great Western 2-Row. Hops: Cascade, Perle. Yeast & Water: Pacman Yeast & Free Range Coastal Water.

Food Pairing: Seafood, Poultry

HISTORY
The Morimoto Soba Ale is part of the new Signature Series of Rogue Ales, launched in the Spring of 2003 with internationally acclaimed Chef Masaharu Morimoto—a James Beard awarded chef and one of the stars of the Food Network series, Iron Chef.

Soba (also known as buckwheat) is not a type of wheat but a member of the rhubarb family and has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of the buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).

AGED 
in French Oak Extra Añejo Tequila Barrels that previously held Bordeaux Wine

CELLAR NOTES
We were so smitten with the initial batch aged in Extra Añejo Tequila barrels that we brought in more barrels and brewed more beer specifically to fill them. The barrels smelled amazing, with aromas of vanilla crème brulée, dulce de leche and tequila. The result is both satisfyingly expected and surprising at the same time: Sweet caramel-like flavors, black pepper, vanilla and tequila notes meld seamlessly with the spice, roasted coffee and chocolate flavors of the base beer for a richly intense experience.

Duvel Tripel Hop is brewed with three hop varieties and each year the third hop is changed to provide its own unique taste and aroma. This keeps the final flavor profile surprisingly exciting for any true beer lover. 

For 2015 our brewers selected the aromatic hop EQUINOX from the USA.

Thanks to the third additional hop variety Equinox, our 2015 selection is characterized with the aroma of grapefruit, lemon and a hint of fresh green pepper.

Equinox hops are added again during ‘dry-hopping’, extracting additional hop aromas into the beer. The higher aromatic intensity rounds out the beer, backing the final alcohol content of 9.5%.

Voor Duvel Tripel Hop selecteren de brouwers elk jaar een derde veelbelovende hopsoort. Zo blijft het uiteindelijke smaakprofiel verrassend boeiend voor elke echte bierliefhebber.

Voor 2015 selecteerden onze brouwers de aromatische hopsoort EQUINOX uit de Verenigde Staten. Dank zij de derde hopsoort kent Duvel Tripel Hop 2015 een fruitig aroma van pompelmoes en limoen, met een lichte toets van groene peper.

Door het toepassen van de ‘dryhopping’ techniek, waarbij we de Equinox hopbellen pas later in het brouwproces toegevoegen, worden deze hop-aroma’s extra waarneembaar.

Till detta har vi kombinerat ihop flera sor- ters malt från Weyermanns mälteri i södra Tyskland. Vårt mål är att skapa ett öl med lätt kropp, men med rik smak som inte är allt för överväldigande – kort sagt – ett passande öl till god husmanskost eller ett gott öl till soci- alt umgänge.

Vi har noga avvägt längden på koktiden för att inte göra ett för beskt öl till denna lätta maltkropp. Ingen humle kokar mer än 40 minuter. Den sista humlegivan sker i en så kallad hop back, en silanordning som vi silar vörten igenom precis innan den pumpas in i vår värmeväxlare.

Despite its richness, it has a faintly smoky dryness in the finish.

A beer that has a dominant malty taste. This beer’s origins 
in a monk’s recipe are reflected in its heartiness. The Pope 
of Beers, Conrad Seidl, describes it as: “Almost black with 
a very slight red tone, a sensational, festive foam and truly extraordinary fragrance that at first summons up visions of greaves lard. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant 
with the aftertaste. There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous platinum medals..",2,['Doppelbock'],3.867

The Mast Brothers make super-dark, incredibly tasty chocolate that shows off their beans’ uninhibited flavors. Using a specially-made, small-scale bean winnower, they separate the fatty nib from the outer husk. While the nibs go on to become chocolate bars, the husks, with all their clean, dark, and savory chocolate flavors, will go into the 4BEANS mash along with beans and barley.

The third bean comes from Stumptown Coffee, our BKLYN (by way of Portland) neighbors equally committed to showcasing their product’s natural character.

This sun was high in a cloudless sky, and the snow a white blanket on the frozen landscape. The scene was Oppigårds Bryggeri in the little village of Ingvallsbenning in Dalarna in Mid-Sweden, which was where Amager Bryghus had decided to have their somewhat belated Christmas party. Our five-man delegation was already in a party mood when we arrived from the outskirts of Tårnby, but soon we focused entirely on the beer. Just like Amager Bryghus, Oppigårds have a predilection for good and fresh American aroma hops, so we simply followed the laws of nature and made our collaboration beer a so-called West Coast IPA. Thanks for the invitation, Oppigårds, and for building bridges between Swedish and Danish brew craftsmanship. And may we take this opportunity to once more offer our apologies. For everything.

Første inkarnation af denne øl blev brygget på den sprødest tænkelige vinterdag i januar, hvor solen stod højt på en skyfri himmel, og sneen lå hvid og tæt og dækkede det bundfrosne landskab. Stedet var Oppigårds Bryggeri i den lille landsby Ingvallsbenning i Dalarna i Midtsverige, hvortil Amager Bryghus havde henlagt sin noget forsinkede julefrokost. Muligvis var det også julefrokosthumør, der prægede den 5 mand høje delegation her fra det ydre Tårnby, da vi ankom, men fokus blev hurtigt rettet mod øllet.

They also assisted the monks at the Trappist brewery Westmalle, who also brewed their version of a triple. The brewmaster at Westmalle changed the recipe in 1956 by adding more hops and from there the triple became what we know today. The name triple may come from its alcohol strength as: X for the weakest strength, medium strength XX and XXX for the strongest beer, equivalent to 3% by volume, 6 % by volume and 9% vol. It is fermented with fresh Belgian Trappist yeast combined with a good handful of bitter hops, lots of Belgian malt and cane sugar. The beer should be enjoyed at 10-12°C, (50-54°F) in a Munkebo glass to highlight the beer’s amazing aroma and taste of Belgian fruit esters and hops flowery fragrance.

Sif is the goddess of the harvest, Thor’s wife and is described as the most beautiful among women. She has golden hair, Loki as a bad joke, cut off all her real hair, after lying with her one night. The new golden hair is magically attached to her head and grows now as true hair of gold.

With generous additions of Simcoe ,Amarillo and Cascade hops throughout the brewing, fermentation and conditioning phases, balanced with heaps of organic pale malt, we designed this to not rip your taste buds off your tongue, but rather vigorously stimulate them and your palate into a lupulinecstacy of pleasure.
During the cross-country truck trip our brewery made to find it’s home in Astoria it was nearly scattered to the cornfields of Nebraska by a tornado. We try to capture some of nature’s intensity in every pint.

21325,The Carpenter's Mikan Ale,5697,6.1,0,"""The 2006 Carpenter's Mikan Ale is both piquantly tart and satiatingly sweet. Loads of freshly peeled and crushed mikans (70 Kg in this 500 liter batch) are added to the wort at the completion of boiling. The beer is dry-hopped in the conditioning tank with additions of the citrusy American hop Cascade. The beer has a fairly high original gravity (15.7 Plato) and thus sports a sneakingly potent alcohol punch (approximately 6.1% by volume). In the glass, The Carpenter's Mikan Ale introduces itself with a densely creamy snow-white head. The color is a captivatingly turbid orange-amber hue that is almost spellbinding in its organic honesty. The nose features the exhilaratingly delicate aroma of freshly peeled mikans and something else citrus -- Cascade hops? In the mouth, one sensation above all holds sway -- effervescent freshness! The finish is mysteriously ephemeral; the beer vanishes leaving the taste buds standing at attention in an alert state of pleasurable surrender, as if coyly imploring, ""More, please!"" Mikan is a sort of Japanese tangerine, only without the seeds. We receive the mikans for this wonderfully piquant, citrusy brew from the Heda garden of our carpenter friend, Nagakura-san, and hence the name. The beer is wheat-based and its zesty, thirst-quenching character masks a big alcohol punch (approximately 6.9%). The citrus character derived from the mikans is further buttressed by loads of citrusy American Amarillo and Cascade hops. This is a brew truly like no other. Cheers to the Carpenter!""

So what’s so great about rye? Look at it this way: rye is the bad-boy cousin to those two better-known grains, barley and wheat. There’s nothing delicate about it; it’s tough and it grows where it wants, when it wants. Rye is fun, but it has an edge to it, like a gruff antihero riding into town. It’s got complex spicy, nutty flavors, and that makes it exciting, but it sometimes gets a little out of hand, especially when it hangs out with equally edgy American hops.

Don’t get us wrong, rye can be silky smooth and seductive when it wants to be, making it pretty irresistible at times. Brooklyn I Wanna Rye-It takes that wayward grain on a little joy ride through spicy flavors, a light smack of caramel, an explosive pop of hops and a sharp dry finish. And when your pint is finished, we think you’ll pick yourself up, dust off your jacket, smile and ask us for another one.

Selected specifically because of their aromatic qualities, these Pacific Northwest varieties contribute a pungent blend of grapefruit, stone fruit, and floral notes. A generous malt bill and a solid dollop of honey provide just enough body to keep the balance in check, resulting in a remarkably drinkable rendition of the Double India Pale Ale style.",5,"['Ipa - Imperial', 'Double']",4.381
