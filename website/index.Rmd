# **Predicting the Demand of Beer Styles**
*Capstone project for UC Berkeley MIDS, Sping 2016*

## GOAL:
### Help brewers make the right beer in the right place at the right time.

<br>

## But Why Beer Models?

**The Craft Beer industry is a significant market that is rapidly growing.**

**Understanding beer demand is hard today.  There is no rigorous data analytics tools to enable brewers to have insights into demand and customer preference.**

## Brewery Supply and Demand

According to the data available through the [Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/fred.html), 
the total inventory of beer has grown fairly linearly over the last 20+ years. 
The sales of beer has grown as well, but not matching the inventory quite exactly.  

In the chart below, notice the seasonality in the sales of beer as each year, especially  
that the months of January and February dip greatly from the peak months of November 
and December. Starting about 2007 you can also see that inventory starts growing 
faster than sales, which corresponds to beginning of the rise of craft and micro breweries 
popping up accross the country.  

```{r prepare_sales, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
fred_sales = read.csv("FRED_inventory_sales.csv")
fred_sales = fred_sales[, c(2, 3, 4)]
fred_sales$month = as.Date(fred_sales$month)
fred_sales = as.xts(fred_sales[, 2:3], order.by = fred_sales[, 1])
```

```{r ts_graph_sales, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dygraph(fred_sales, main = "Brewery Supply and Demand") %>%
  dyLegend(width = 600) %>%
  dyRangeSelector()
```

## Brewery Price Indices

### What is a Price Index?

**From the [Bureau Of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htmhttp://www.bls.gov/ppi/data.htm)**

> The Producer Price Index (PPI) program measures the average change over time in 
> the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices 
> included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products 
> and some services.

The data on price indices shows PPI for several different goods produced by breweries. 
A PPI always has an initial date at which the index began. 
This index date is usually when the agency recording began
collecting data and is set to 100 for each of the categories below. 
The index date for each category below is June 1, 1982.

```{r prepare_date, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
fred_idx = read.csv("fred_idx.csv")
fred_idx = fred_idx[, c(1, 2, 4, 5, 6)]
fred_idx$index_date = as.Date(fred_idx$index_date)
colnames(fred_idx) = c("index_date", "cases_bottles", "cases_cans", "barrels_and_kegs", "overall")
fred_idx = as.xts(fred_idx[, 2:5], order.by = fred_idx[, 1])
```

```{r ts_graph_idx, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dygraph(fred_idx, main = "Brewery Price Index Data") %>%
  dyLegend(width = 600) %>%
  dyRangeSelector()
```

## The solution and MVP:

> A set of exploratory and predictive analytics on the U.S. beer industry for brewers, using a number of public data sources.

<br>

## Data Science Approach

**Get data**

- Sales data and consumption data from various sources
- Untappd, OpenBeerDB, FRED, Twitter

**Clean and transform data**

- Load all data into uniform RDBMS

**Explore**

- Do exploratory analysis to understand correlations and trends

**Model**

- Build and test various models to predict ratings, sentiment, and consumption location, including multiple models by style and location

**Present and polish**

- Visualize models in a Shiny dashboard for breweries to use

<br>

## Future Roadmap  

- Add sentiment aggregated by style to supplement maps
- Adapt style model to account for regional biases in data 
- Keep looking for new data sources to incorporate
- Get more feedback from breweries of what problems they have that data science can solve

**Data for the charts above came from the [Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/fred.html)**

*FRED速 stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data. FRED速 contains frequently updated US macro and regional economic time series at annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily frequencies. FRED速 aggregates economic data from a variety of sources- most of which are US government agencies. The economic time series in FRED速 contain observation or measurement periods associated with data values. For instance, the US unemployment rate for the month of January, 1990 was 5.4 percent and for the month of January, 2000 was 4.0 percent.*

We used the FRED API to extract data on the supply and sales of beer over a 20 year period,
as well as price indices for breweries.
