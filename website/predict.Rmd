# Predicted Beer Rating 

Would you like to know how highly a certain style of beer would be rated given
varying ABV or IBU?

*The predicted “rating” is a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “poor” and 5 being “great”.*

*Alcohol by volume (**ABV**) is a standard measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage expressed as a volume percent.*


*International Bitterness Units (**IBU**) scale, a gauge of beer's bitterness. What IBUs measure are the parts per million of isohumulone found in a beer. Isohumulone is the acid found in hops that gives beer its bitter bite.*
